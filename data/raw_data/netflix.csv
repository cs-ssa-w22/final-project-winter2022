6,2022-02-14,"Applied  online and then had a phone screen.   I'm not sure if the recruiter didnt want to say exactly why I ""wasn't a good fit"" but, they said it was a language skill issue, the role required a french speaker.  I'm writing a negative review because obviously it was not true as a quick linkedin search showed that they hired someone who does not speak french. So, for a big corporation like netflix to lie, its pretty weak..",Why do you want to work at Netflix.
7,2022-02-11,"I had a few phone screenings. I followed up multiple times  to ask about the process, when next steps would happen etc... After a few months Netflix recruiters stopped responding which I found pretty disrespectful given I work in entertainment and have relationships with Netflix other than applying for a job. I understand that this happens all the time especially at large corporations, but Netflix claims to have a unique company culture that fosters all these amazing things, I hope that the communication of the recruiting team doesn't reflect communication in the rest of the company.",What team would you like to be on? Why Netflix?

Not a good experience overall.,Which culture/ value do you resonate most in Netflix?

18,2022-01-25,"Spoke with HR for roughly 30-40 minutes.  Covered all the basic questions you'd expect around prior job experience, how my experience relates to this role.  Was also asked about salary expectations.  I got the impression that they were very interested in continuing me to the next phase as that was stated on the call.  Two weeks have passed and so I've gone ahead and assumed they aren't interested since neither my initial Thank You email (which had a question included) or my follow up email a week later have been acknowledged.  Will say for all those interviewing, apparently you should read their company culture page before your first interview.  I had not and you would have thought that was the most important question I was asked.  I admitted I had not but would be happy to do so in preparation for the next round call which she was discussing setting up (keep in mind no one mentioned or provided it prior to the call so it's like finding out there was homework no one told you about)",What do you think of the company culture statement?
19,2022-01-21,First interview with internal recruiter. Quite informal and pleasant. Second interview with department manager was set to inconvenient time due to LA timezone.

20,2022-01-20,"Met recruiter who found me online.  Set up first interview which was in person with the hiring VP.  The rest of the 5 interviews were online.  After the last interview, there was nothing.  No thank you.  Nothing.",The questions are around their culture and you need to give examples of your experience in how you manage that cultural pillar.  Each interview has one of the pillars.  For example>direct and frank conversations and feedback.
21,2022-01-20,The interview process was very extensive with various rounds of interviews and panels. It took a while to hear back from the recruiters for next steps during the interview process.,What would you say would be a challenge for you in this role? 
22,2022-01-19,I was given a case study related to Netflix Gift Cards and was asked to write SQL queries for the given questions. The interviewer expects you to have an optimized query.,My work experience and projects
23,2022-01-17,Questions were not too much difficult and more generic interview type questions. Very brief and short answer type responses over all.  The interview process was virtual and online rather than need to come in to the office at all.,Tell us about yourself and why you are looking at this position. 
24,2022-01-15,"There was a casual 1 hour (maybe can vary from position to position) talk w/ talent coordinator, and then moved on to the interview with team manager, which took shorter than the former one. There were no real face-to-face process.",What is your future career path in mind?
25,2022-01-09,The initial phone interview was very straight forward. Recruiter briefly explained role well and gave room to ask questions. It was not very technical mostly to screen candidate's energy and check resume.,Tell me about yourself please
26,2022-01-08,"Netflix recruiter reached out to me from an animation festival, we talked through my portfolio, and he suggested a few things to add/change. Then encourage me to reach out again after.","What's your favorite project that you've done and why?

27,2022-01-07,"Netflix proactively reached out to me. I spoke with the recruiter, hiring manager, and another content designer. The recruiter said the team knew my current work and that they were excited about the prospect of bringing me on. I completed a take-home writing exercise, then two days later. the recruiter emailed me something along the lines of ""You're not what the team is looking for"" with no other feedback on the homework.",Why are you looking to make a move at this time?

The assistants and executives were wonderful as well.",Tell me about yourself. Do you have experience writing ____?
30,2022-01-03,"I was contacted at first by the in house HR Recruiter and then interviewed via Zoom by the ""hiring manager"".  This interview went really well, the hiring manager said ""we're going to definitely advance you in the process, you seem like a good fit and you will hear back from us"".  While this was said convincingly, I still had to follow up twice before hearing back 2 weeks later.  Then, out of no where, I was scheduled for an interview with 6 members of the team for 3 back to back to back 2 person interviews that took place over several hours on a weekday.  I did research on all of my interviewers before speaking with them, it was a mix of some people very new to my particular form of engineering and some that were more experienced then myself.    While the job description and interview with the hiring and recruiting managers implied this would be a design based position (at least 50-75% of the time) all of the other people I spoke with presented it as a support position 90% of the time).  I'm making up percentages here, but you get what I mean.  I am more than capable of doing support in my field, but this is not what I prepped for.  All that being said, I felt like the process went well for me.  I didn't have any major snafus, I gave my experience in detail and admitted what I had not done and detailed what I had very honestly.  I was left with the impression that after 7 conversations that day and 2 prior that I was likely to land the position.  This was not reality.  After I was told by the last interviewee (the most tenured at Netflix of all I spoke with) that I'd hear back in a day or two, I heard nothing.  Over a full week later, I checked in and a day or two after that I was told I did not get the position.  9 days after completing a run of 9 conversations over the course of a month.  After that level of time dedication and conversation, a company shouldn't ghost someone for 9 days.  I should say, I have over 25 years in the workforce, I have interviewed and applied for far more positions then I can remember, so I never fully ""got my hopes up"" in spite of every signal that I should.  I was even LinkedIn by one of the Netflix folks that were part of the process.   But what if I wasn't so experienced?  To be lead along in this way really shows some flaws in the company and the way people are treated that leave me relieved I didn't get the job.  I should also say that 3 of the 6 of what would have been my peers didn't have more then a year of experience each.  1 was about equal to my experience, 1 had far more years in a different form of engineering then mine and 1 was very well certified and experienced (more then myself on paper at least).  That being said, I was told this was a ""team"" decision.    I read fully through Netflix' culture memo, it's mantra during the interview process, so if you want a job there I suggest you do the same.  Many questions come up directly about it or that are related to you existing within it in some abstract way.  In that memo it talks a lot about a circular process where one person doesn't independently make decisions.  I think this is fine on paper for some decisions made by hired employees,, but in hiring meetings probably worked against me.   I walk away feeling that if I had at least been given the opportunity to meet with the hiring manager for another round to address the notes of the staff I could have made a better impression.  Instead I was analyzed by some staffers that really didn't have the work experience to make these kinds of decisions and almost all of them were located on the other side of the country.   The actual staff on my coast only accounted for 2 of the 8 people I spoke with.  I still believe in Netflix as a fan of the work they do and still generally believe in the culture memo they are very upfront about promoting.  I feel I would have been a good fit there theoretically.  But in retrospect, there were red flags.  Not getting call backs and having to remind them every time for one.  Almost every call or meeting with anyone at the company started late (either they are over worked or rude).  There was also, from many, a reluctance to tell me much about their experience at the company and how they felt about it.  It seems a bit insular there, the preaching of individuality sounded great from the outside in the memo, but in the small taste I had interviewing on the ""inside"" I'm not sure how it plays out in real life.  To that point, another red flag is aside from 2 of the people I spoke to, no one had been with the company more then 3 years and at least 3 had been there less then 1 year themselves.    Just my two cents, I'm not stressing it because I know that if a company doesn't immediately want you, it's not worth it because it wouldn't be the right fit anyway.  Good luck to all at Netflix and that spoke with me.",Q - What would you do if you disagreed vehemently with a decision being made within your department?

32,2021-12-24,The recruiter doesn't even know how to ask the right questions. She asked questions insinuating that she did not believe I could get the role due to the work experience on my CV,"Can you tell me how you will use an African perspective on the UX and UI designs at Netflix

33,2021-12-24,"Initial screening call with recruiter, then set up interviews with over 5 people across the business, including the line manager and the same recruiter who did the initial screening call. (Unclear why the recruiter couldn't just build their questions into the screening call).  It's quite a long and involved process but good to meet various people to see what they think/typical employees are like.  As so many interviews are scheduled across a few days sometimes, it would be good to know at the beginning of each day if you're still in the running. Otherwise it would definitely be a waste of everyone's time.","A LOT about the culture memo, including your thoughts on it.

Do emphasize what you're looking for, not what you're running from. (They headhunted me so I didn't have a vision prepared of what I hoped to find at Netflix.) Tech screen was a sort of stream-of-consciousness Q and A through my CV to probe for technical depth. Interviewer interrupted a lot, which is understandable to keep things moving toward the goals, but twice it seemed premature enough to me that I redirected back to what I was saying so I could finish my thought.

36,2021-12-10,"The interview process was straightforward and quick (to start). It consisted of 3 rounds (recruiter, hiring manager, and the panel of 6-9 people) but then took a long time for them to get back to me to tell me I didn't get it.

38,2021-12-06,Did a phone interview of about an hour. Standard questions about how I handled certain situations previously. Very unusual in 2021 that the role was strictly office based although can be done easily remote. Company didn’t want to compromise on that. Interviewer shared with me further details by email and asked for feedback and then never heard from them. Sent them a remider and still no response. Not a good experience.,What is not working well in your current job and how would you change that?
39,2021-12-01,"They reached out to me and asked to interview me. It was a lot different than many companies I've interviewed for. There's multiple interviews that are very time consuming. There's also tasks that they want you to complete to make sure that you are efficient. I made it to the final interview but not sure why they can't just let me know they are not interested in the very beginning than wasting my time. Don't interview unless you have an amazing background with lots of experience. They only hire the best of the best.

I was able to speak about my experience, and he said I sounded like a shoe-in for the position.  When I spoke to the hiring manager, he asked me a bunch of vague questions and didn't really seem to know what he wanted for the role. When I mentioned I applied for the interview and didn't get contacted by a recruiter, the interview turned for the worse. I could immediately tell he was done with me.  At the end of the interview, he said he wanted to be transparent and told me I failed the interview, and he would not be moving forward. he asked if he could tell me how I answered the questions incorrectly, and I declined.  This was interview number 6 in my current loop and was by far the worst, and I've been through real meat grinders.

50,2021-11-12,"I complied bug lists for Netflix for many years, hoping to eventually get a chance to work there and 1) fix the darn bugs and 2) help them innovate their way out of the ultimate commodification of the extremely crowded streaming video market. 	Early in my career I spent 4 formative years at a company with a culture similar to that described in Netflix's culture document. This high individual responsibility culture is how I came to approach all my positions at every company I then worked for - and I was eagerly anticipating a kind of ""returning home"" glow and familiarity during the interview and, hopefully, day-to-day work at Netflix. 	However, it was a very strange interview: very confrontational. Was he just trying to provoke me and see how I would argue my case? I did argue my case each time but he refused to, or pretended to, not hear me and never acknowledged having heard or understood my points.  	Insisted my intention to help grow Netflix's market cap by 10X meant that I liked the size of corps that had room to grow 10X, as opposed to my desire, expressed several times, for my ideas and efforts impacting 10X growth to the bottom line (which I believe any one of us is capable of given opportunity and the will to do so - especially for such a rich technology-powered market like streaming video). 	Insisted EngProd was exclusive of toolkits, frameworks (and debuggers and IDEs) and that I had no business saying I was passionate about it even though I had worked on all four of those things in the past. 	He stated that any addition to the UI framework would have to be run by all 70 - 100 people who use the framework in order to get their buy in first. I did not mention that I personally thought this to be an onerous anti-pattern, but did say that I would probably find this to be the most challenging part of the position (I am very familiar with UI tech and nothing about what they are currently doing would have been a challenge - just fun as heck). Thereafter, he insisted over and over that, apparently because I said it was a challenge, I was incapable of doing it - instead of me just acknowledging that, as I said, this would be one of my primary focuses until the challenge was overcome. Even after I described how I recently worked on a product that had approximately 20 stakeholders from 3 different organizations and that I had successfully navigated this situation, he expressed his opinion that I would not be up to this task. 	I also mentioned that I had been a consultant for much of my career. He then insisted that I would leave the company earlier than average and, because I was a consultant, I had been able to write crap software and just leave to go to the next assignment - never having to maintain my own code. Despite my average time at a gig being longer than his average term of employment, and longer than most devs in the Bay Area, and that I had left several positions with code less than 1 bug per 10K lines of code - he, true to form, remain unconvinced. 	Like a troll, he insisted that he was right about everything and would not acknowledge any point I would make. 	Finally, I asked why they were still hacking React, trying to make it performant - why didn't they just write their own little toolkit to run on top of all the low-performance platforms they support. His answer was that ""the UI is not a core competency"", and they couldn't afford the engineering resources to support such an effort.  	Well, certainly explains a few things, that does. 	Didn't talk in all CAPS, but... this would be my manager?  	After processing all this - I now understand why Netflix's UI is the way it is (see any comment thread) and has so many bugs (current annoyance is that it pauses for 1/2 second about 1 minute before the end of every video segment as it loads the following segment. Oh, and now the left arrow of their horizontal-scrolling videosnaps disappears and the right arrow appears in the middle of the screen). 	Clue to Netflix: the UI is how you compete with the other dozen of so players in this increasingly crowded market. What happens when relying only on content, increasingly boring content, for differentiation has many historical precedents. As I click back and forth between Prime, Paramount+, HBOMax, Hulu, Disney+, and the rest - I have to wonder about the future of this FAANG.",Tell me about your background.

86,2021-08-18,"I interviewed for a leadership recruiter role at Netflix. The process took several weeks. It consisted of a hiring manager phone interview, a virtual onsite including a series of 1:1's with a presentation, and a final interview with a director from the business group for which I might recruit.  Netflix said they have a strong culture of feedback. I was given feedback that I aced all but one of my interviews and that my presentation was the best they had ever seen.  The one interview they told me I failed, was the interview with the  Diversity, Equality and Inclusivity (DEI) team. The interviewer's feedback was that I did not use Netflix jargon. It was explained to me that the word  ""diversity"" in and of itself is not a word that Netflix uses internally. They use the word ""additive"" to describe diversity. Because I did not use their internal words for how they describe diversity, to them, that meant I was not knowledgeable about diversity.    For full context, I have run my own women in tech organization since 2015 which focuses 100% on diversity and equality.  I am an ally. I am a coach. I am a mentor. I am a leadership recruiter. This is not lip service. It is something I am passionate about.   Maybe the Netflix ""additive team"" is itself not inclusive.  I experienced the very discrimination that Netflix claims they are trying to remedy with the additive team.  And so, I am left believing I was discriminated against because I am white. It really boils down to that. If I aced all the other interviews, including the presentation, I simply wasn't ""woke"" enough for the DEI interviewer.  When the director of recruiting called to inform me they were passing on my candidacy, she did ask me to reach out in July as she said she wanted to hire me the moment she had another spot open. I reached back out to her in July as promised, and I was blown off. I suspected this was a ruse to keep me engaged so I would not write this review. Sadly, it seems that I was right.  I was a lover of Netflix before I met them. The interview process and lack of integrity made me not want to work there.  The feedback from the diversity and inclusion interviewer was deeply insulting.","What is an unconscious bias  you have, that you are aware of, that has affected your hiring?"

I personally thought it went very well. There were smiles and positive feedback every single time a question was thrown at me. Therefore, I left the building very confidently. However, I was told three days later that someone else had gotten the job because I was too ""nonchalant"". I was surprised and so was my recruiter. Everyone that I meet daily literally tells me I'm so full of life and so joyful, including the recruiter that had worked with me through this process. So yes, being told the result was because of me being ""too nonchalant"" was a little hard for me to process. But it's okay, it just means this job was not for me.

273,2020-01-23,"I’ve applied to one of their experimentation data science roles and was contacted by recruiter. I had a 30min chat with the recruiter, learned more about the role and responsibilities and what they are looking for.   After that I had a 30min introductory call with the hiring manager. It went really well, she was genuinely interested in my background and shared some example projects that they are working on.   Then I was scheduled for a technical phone interview. Technical phone interview went great for me. I’ve answered all the questions right and to the point. I was asked very detailed and deep technical ML and NLP questions, which I wasn’t expecting but answered well because I have deep technical expertise in these areas, too.   However, next day recruiter reached out to me saying that they don’t think my background is a good fit, I was literally shocked as I was expecting an onsite interview as the next step. I asked about feedback from the interviewer and recruiter said I didn’t do well on the questions regarding word2vec and L1/L2 regularization. I was shocked once again because L1/L2 regularization is the thing that I am most comfortable with since it was a part of my PhD dissertation. I’ve talked about the unit circles for both l1/l2, how one can be used for feature selection(lasso) whereas the other one can only provide shrinkage (ridge). Why l1is not differentiable at 0 while l2is differentiable and how that helps the algorithm to do feature selection. I went above and beyond for the regularization methods yet the feedback I get is  saying that I didn’t do well on this. For word2vec, I’ve mentioned about the differences between cbow, skip-gram and their advantages and disadvantages, when to use which one etc.   I was very disappointed with the outcome not because I wasn’t invited for the onsite but because when I answered all the questions correct and to the point yet they thought I am not the right fit. Not to mention that, even if I’ve applied and interviewed for the Experimentation role, I wasn’t asked even a single question on experimentation. I was asked NLP and very detailed ML algorithmic questions, which I am okay with, but I wish I’d known that that was going to be the interview.   Anyways, overall it was a great experience and recruiters as well as hiring manager were really great. They made the process smooth and enjoyable.

277,2019-12-30,"The process was lengthy - too many phases. Questions were easy. Slow recruiters were the biggest issue.   The process consisted of: - Phone call with the recruiter - Phone call with the hiring manager - 2 phone calls / technical screens with the engineers - On-site day of interviews (5 sessions) - in my case it was Los Angeles - Second on-site day of interviews - in my case it would be Los Gatos  I applied out of curiosity to a Full Stack SDE position in their Marketing department, while being a Principal SDE at a public company. It took about 5 days of their recruiter to contact me for a first chat.  Then we had a phone call with their engineering manager. She described the team, checked my soft skills, asked for thoughts about their 5-pages culture article. It took the recruiter 8 days to update me about the results :(  Then we had a technical screening phone call consisting of 2 sessions 30-45 minutes long each. In each of those sessions 2 engineers asked me to do coding tasks in Coderpad. The tasks were primitive - refactor some code, write a couple of tests, give example of an XSS, etc.  After that I was invited to Netflix office in Hollywood for a day of interviews. The area looked quite bad for living/working/commuting.   Got both positive and negative impression from the on-site interviews. I liked meeting the hiring manager and two engineers, while didn't like meetings with the project manager and the second recruiter (they seemed to be ""robots""). Also - lol - my host just abandoned me.  First session - technical interview. Their SDE gave me a task to whiteboard (see below). He answered a couple of questions. Then he ran away fast after the interview, but overall he was live and invested into the process.  Second session - talk with the engineering manager again. Questions about my ideas how to deal with people, situations, etc. Gave me a technical task to whiteboard (see below). Asked her my questions - the answers aligned with my views. The only questionable thing is that the manager seemed to be an unneeded layer - as all my questions on how she helped developers resulted in ""developers are very independent and should solve everything themself"". So her role was just about hiring new people and signing salary checks. But the discussion was overall useful, and she was an interesting person.  Third session - technical interview. An SDE gave me a coding task to whiteboard (see below). Then we had a long forced chat on different topics regarding the life at Netflix. Basically, my host lady met me in the morning and said she would come after the third session to show the office and get some snacks. The SDE was hopelessly trying to locate her via Slack, and when it failed we had to talk with him until the next interview. I got insights about the life there. Some stories were questionable - e.g. how the first SDE I met that day spent a week on changing a properly working build process to use a different tool, because he personally liked it more (the story was provided to glorify the productivity of Netflix folks, but looked like a waste of time / money).   The forth interview seemed like a chat with ""robot"" - a mechanical walk-through the list of soft-skills questions.  The meeting with a second recruiter finished the day. Again a ""robot-like"" style of questions about soft skills and experience. Well, the person was alive - but seemed to have a professional deformation because of working as a recruiter for like ten years already. He was asking the list of questions he had to ask, smiling to play his role, laughing when he needed to laugh. Was not interested much in the process. Happened to be the most flawed link in the chain of interviewers. Promised to give me the results in like 3 days - never happened.   7 days later that recruiter emailed me to find some time to talk. All those attempts failed. First, he didn't read email with my response until next afternoon (one should believe, that Netflix recruiters do not read emails in the morning). Then he failed to call me on the day when he scheduled the call. And didn't even follow-up the next day. I had to contact the hiring manager and the other recruiter. Only after that - 10 days after the on-site interviews - got an email that I didn't pass due to over-complicating solutions to the tech tasks, also due to some concerns regarding my culture answers.   My conclusion regarding the tech results: kids, do not show your knowledge to Netflix, rather solve the tasks in the easiest manner :) Regarding the culture questions - it's up to Netflix to decide what answers they like.  To summarize: - Liked - strong language of their culture doc, tasks and scale, meeting the team members (not just some unrelated engineers) - Didn't like - working with the second recruiter (uhhh...), chat with the project manager, the LA area of the office (traffic, congestion, appearance).","You're working on a video editor and need to show events (identified by start and end timestamps) in swimlane tracks.

308,2019-06-26,"Phase 1 – Phone Screening A recruiter reached out to schedule the phone interview which lasted about 30 min. I was told the importance of their culture and we spoke more about that than the job itself. Initially I was very excited about this role and couldn't wait to move through the process.   Phase 2 –  Phone Interview with Hiring Manager Talked to the hiring manager about the specifics of the role. We got along great and I had tons of experience that fit with the role.   Phase 3 – On-site Interview You're going to Hollywood baby! Weird thing - in the official Netflix interview itinerary email it stated that you may not last the entire day and be asked to leave at any point. I was like 'Ummmm..what?' Super creepy and stressful. Not really normal whatsoever but let's roll with it.  Netflix paid for me to fly down to Los Angeles. Trip included a plane ticket, rental car, one night at the Hotel Rosevelt and food.  So far I was beyond excited and was feeling the vibe. I arrived at Netflix LA HQ and was really impressed with their offices and location in general. I was greeted by an HR rep and was escorted to an interview room.  So far, so good.  The interviews lasted about 8 hours with 30min-1 hour conversations per person.  They were a mixture of video Google calls to Los Gatos and face-to-face with folks from the LA office. Overall the conversations were enlightening and thoughtful. A few people tried to trip me up along the way but didn't think much of it.   Things started to get weird when a recruiter entered the room after about 4 hours of interviews and drilled me on culture. It felt like every answer I had was wrong and I couldn't understand why this person showed up to just pick at me and try to trip me up.  She was actually rude if I am being honest. After that the hiring manager came back into the room and wanted to clarify some of the things I said to this rude recruiter. At this point I was going in to damage control mode and was stressing out a little.   So what did I say? Basically that I didn't fire people. Even though I have let 2 people I managed go in the past, it wast good enough. They wanted brutal blunt force and kept talking about ensuring we have a 'high performing team' environment. Reflecting back,  all the culture questions really boiled down to survival and what was my threshold for letting people go and providing fearful feedback to the creative team.   Another weird thing that happened on culture - They asked me specifics about Netflix culture and wanted me to almost recite parts of it back to them. Luckily I carefully read it and tried to provide examples back to them on how awesome it was. I told them about how some of my current colleagues don't like to share documents and keynote presentations and how I understand why Netflix had an open share/collaboration rule. That was a TRIGGER and they grilled me on this in detail. I kept saying 'I'm against keeping documents under wraps and not sharing' again and again but it was like they liked the fact my current company culture had some issues. Again I kept reiterating how against that behavior I was but was too late. They got me. What an un-hirable person I must be, oh my!  At this point I was thinking 'Ok here is where they ask me to leave just like the email warned me about' but I lasted the entire day.  The last interview was with an HR Director and AGAIN we went over culture. Lot's of trick questions looped in and felt like everyone was trying to lead me into incorrect answers, then get irritated if I didn't say the right thing. One weird question was about failure and they wanted details about a time I failed. I gave them an honest answer and did my best to turn it into a positive. Whatever. He let me know that at Netflix you will receive lots of honest feedback from your peers and was I ok with this. ""Oh of course!!"" I said with a smile on my face.  In my head I'm thinking 'what kind of jerks work here'? Why can't we just do our best and stop psychoanalyzing each-other!!??  I was totally exhausted and couldn't imagine talking to another soul for the rest of my life. I flew back home and still wanted the job even though I some some weird bumps in the interview process. I really tried my best and would give Netflix 100%.  I wrote a thank you email to the hiring manager. Crickets. A few days later I wrote direct messages to other folks I met. Crickets. Another few days go by, a few more thank you emails and question on next steps to HR. Crickets.  Finally got a voicemail from the 1st recruiter telling me I didn't get the job.  I know why – it's because of my culture question mis-steps. Again they wanted a manager to fire others and instill fear for other to perform.   At the end of the day I'm relieved  I didn't get the job since I myself would have been fired for not being the right type of manager at Netflix. So the weird crazy process played out in its abusive strange way for the best.","Tell us about Netflix's culture

315,2019-06-03,"I applied on Linked In and a few weeks later got invited to an initial screening with the recruiter. The recruiter was extremely nice (in fact everyone I talked to seemed extremely nice, just very busy). The recruiter was happy with me so we moved along to the first interview with the hiring manager. I have to say that I was well informed that this is a long process and I'll be going through several panels. This is a trend I don't appreciate in the hiring process in IT companies, as to me, if you don't know what you think about the candidate after 3 rounds, your hiring process is faulty, but it is what it is.  Anyhow, upon speaking to the hiring manager I learned that an experience in production is crucial to this job - this was NOT mentioned in the job description (it said it would be helpful; not a must).  At that point I realized this was probably not the job for me, as I can't fake experience I don't have. After the interview with the hiring manager I didn't get any feedback, so a week later I contacted the recruiter who informed me they are looking for someone with production experience so they will put my application on hold.   3 weeks later the recruiter reached out again and said the hiring manager would like to press ahead with my application. I already felt that it was a waste of time for me and for them since I am not what they're looking for, but went ahead because I won't say no to an interview like that. They asked for my availability and I provided it. A week later I didn't hear back so emailed again, and they finally scheduled 4 (!!!) more rounds, half hour each.   Those interviews where really just behavioral/personality discussions, it was nice and chill to talk to the team members, and I got a good feeling from them and that I still have a chance. I then had another call with the recruiter who told me they really like me and want to find a role for me. I then met with the hiring manager again, who said they are still looking for someone with production experience. I don't get that - you KNOW this is something I don't have. You knew it from the beginning. If you don't know what it is you're looking for, figure it out before you waste YOUR time as well as the candidates', not to mention most of the interviews were done cross-continentally so at 8 and 9pm. It's not ideal, and it's not fair of Netflix to use candidates to collect data on what is or isn't available in the region.  Anyhow, a week after my last call with the hiring manager, I emailed the recruiter for feedback. She replied 5 days later saying after long consideration they decided to not go with me. Fair enough, but it was a WAY too long process to arrive at the conclusion the hiring manager had the first time we chatted a couple moths ago. Please consider I spent at least 4 hours on these interviews of my spare time, not to mention all the time and resources Netflix spent on me. I know you don't like processes, but in this case you may benefit from one...  Better hiring process and better role definitions from the get go will save you money and time.","Stuff like who you are, personality questions"

After that, I went on site and interviewed with 4 people for 30 min each, back-to-back. The on-site interview was the most difficult part, mostly because there was no break in between each person. I never got the time to collect my thoughts or take notes in between interviews. Everyone was very nice and professional during the interviews. I did have an awkward moment with the last interviewer when we were walking out after the interview. I was trying to get to know her and asked if she was currently watching any shows. (It being Netflix and all). She simply said, ""no"" and left it at that. Then we did the rest of the elevator ride in silence.

321,2019-05-15,"The interview process with Netflix was so unpleasant that I felt the need to post my first-ever company review. For a company that prides themselves on a ""seamless candidate experience,"" this was exactly the opposite. Firstly, the recruiter was 45-minutes late calling me for our scheduled call - I only received a call after I followed up with her inquiring if we needed to reschedule. Shortly after, she called and a last-minute interviewer, (Supervisor I believe), had been added in to the mix. There was lack of warmth and personal touch from both. It was a weird call; I was left questioning why they had even set-up the call in the first place. I was not asked one question about myself in terms of skill-set, experience, what I can bring, what I've done, where I've been, who I am etc. I was only asked about the culture, why I had chosen Netflix and what I like to watch.   When I had mentioned recently relocating to the area and picking up a temporary recruiting position while I sought permanent employment, I was asked in a rude tone, (the ONLY question she asked, might I add), ""well then why did you apply to Netflix?"" Surely, not all candidates have the luxury of not working while they seek something permanent. Should I really need to explain that I’d prefer not to have job gaps and I like income? She seemed inexperienced and that was the only question she could pull out. After the most awkward, 15-min call, I was told that although my answers were ""impressive"" and ""stood out,"" I wouldn't be the right fit. I was taken aback in how this info was so uncomfortably delivered to me during a screen. I was genuinely curious to know why, (seen as I wasn't asked anything about my myself besides my TV preferences); to which the interviewer provided a response that didn't make any sense coupled with they have more ""qualified"" applicants for this role, (I was actually overly-qualified).   Not everyone is a fit - fair enough - being an experienced recruiter, I definitely empathize with and understand that. However, I was prepped and excited for my call. I love the Netflix brand, am an avid user of the product and this opportunity was with company I wanted to represent and hire for. However, I got off the phone feeling low, defeated and just completely put-off. The entire interviewing scenario was disappointing and distasteful and not what I would have expected from such a renowned media company who emphasizes a ""people” culture.","1.

327,2019-04-23,"1) I applied through their website.  Within about a week I received an email from recruitment to set up a phone interview.  I was told to review the famous Culture Memo.  2) We spoke on the phone a few days later.  Recruitment was very personable and believed my experience matched well with the position.  She of course asked me about the Culture Memo; I knew the reputation of this interview so I had some buzzwords memorized and made sure I sounded engaged and impressed with this ""unique"" way of running a business.  Before the interview concluded, she said she planned on speaking with the potential boss soon because she really thought I was a good fit.  3) Over a week later I spoke with the boss on the phone. Very nice, but 95% of the conversation was about the Culture Memo.  I assumed this would happen, so I again memorized buzzwords and made sure my personal working style and experiences matched the Memo.  She claimed to highly value empathy. She thought I was a good fit and wanted me to come in the following week.  4) Started off well.  An assistant brought me to a small conference room and handed me a goodie bag of waters, mints, and a notepad.  Then it took a turn when I met everyone.  *An onsite recruiter: a nightmare. She looked at her computer most of the time and responded to me with either a smirk or eye-roll.  Then oddly she told me how she only moved to LA because she followed her boyfriend here and would really like to return to SF. And then she ended her portion by telling me that a lot of people don't abide by the culture and that the elevators suck.  Great?  *An executive in the dept: a snoozefest, literally. Nice, but could barely keep her eyes open, slouched in her chair, very soft spoken, and even admitted she wished there were more hours in the day.  So they overwork you here?  Fabulous.  And she also complained about the elevators.  Ok, I get it.  They stink.  *The boss: a complete 180. The fun person on the phone was now dull.  She's a front facing person (often in their social media campaigns), but she must've taken some acting classes to get through them.  The charisma and enthusiasm were gone.  *Current assistant: overtly bubbly.  So much so, that I didn't quite believe her.  This facade faded when I asked her how long this process to replace her was taking; she lost her energy and said months, admitting that she was overworked.  She is currently doing multiple jobs.  Yuck. (And again, complained about the elevators too).  5) The next day I did my due diligence and sent everyone I met with (including the original person I spoke with on the phone), a thank you email.  No response from anyone.  I checked in again after 14 days and received a voicemail saying I wasn't a fit for the position, but a good culture fit.  6) Lesson from this experience: the Culture Memo is nothing original: essentially trust your coworkers and treat everyone with respect.  Duh, that's what every company wants and claims to follow.  The people I met with seemed either bitter, exhausted, boring, or insincere -- or a combination of all four.

330,2019-04-06,"Got contacted by a recruiter. After couple of phone screens, was invited onsite. I was given the option of going through 4 rounds of technical interview and 3 rounds of leadership interview  the same day or 2 different days. I chose to do them on 2 separate days.   4 rounds of technical onsite interviews went well,  2 with managers and 2 with engineers that the candidate is expected to work on a daily basis. 3 of the Interviews were heavily focused on distributed services design, architecture & data modeling and one was on data structure & algorithm. All the interviews were free flowing conversations, the managers and engineers were all nice, respectful & patient during the whole process. Questions were all very practical and things all software engineers end up tackling on a daily basis.  After the technical onsite, I was told the feedback was positive and was invited back for interview with leadership team. We discussed the Netflix culture, I expressed that as opposed to Netflix's culture that says ""We mix work and personal time"", I prefer to keep them separate  and not mix them as I explained work/life balance is extremely important to me and that I don't want to keep checking emails and spending time on work during nights and weekends as an expectation. From talking to all of them, I got a sense that ""email peeking"" culture exists as everyone has it setup on their personal phone. It was said there is nothing like work/life balance but more work/life overlap and also that it is not acceptable if you look at the email and chose not to reply, instead it is expected that you reply that ""I will respond on Monday or tomorrow"". I felt the expectation to acknowledge emails consistently as unreasonable. And how does one tell if one looked at the email or not?  This sounded like a very slippery slope situation to me.  Few other statements from the culture memo that I expressed my disagreement with.  ""We model ourselves on being a team, not a family. A family is about unconditional love, despite, say, your siblings’ bad behavior. A dream team is about pushing yourself to be the best teammate you can be, caring intensely about your teammates, and knowing that you may not be on the team forever. ""  I am okay with this but this has to go both ways. I can spend weekends and nights helping my sibling but not my employer.   ""Keeper's test"" that manager's use to keep or fire an employee. But there are no safeguards in place so that managers don't abuse it or use it for their own benefit. You are expected to take a leap of faith that the all managers will be fair.  For a company that claims ""extraordinary candor"",  including where one can see who said what about you during their ""360"",  salaries and raises are not shared.  From what I could gather, unlimited vacation translates to 4-6 weeks of vacation.   After the leadership interview rounds I felt there was mutual understanding that we are not compatible on each other's work culture expectations and I was expecting a no offer email which I got after 2 days.",NA

Your task is to guide a collaborative session with the team where we form a plan around the

high-level vs detail, short vs long-term, innovation vs risk, strategic vs tactical. Examples of
things you could consider include staffing, architecture, operations, and quality. We're
looking for someone who has enough grasp of technology that they can use it to solve
problems and then organize and align teams around those solutions, while also questioning
and helping to shape the organization vision. At Netflix, we want our interviews to bring out
your best. To that end, you have a lot of freedom in how you choose to engage with us.
Note that we do not expect an entire presentation prepared ahead-of-time, the intent is to
work together to develop a solution and debate it.
The Good
You've been hired as the new CTO of a budding online food-delivery service in the Bay
Area. We've enjoyed early success getting three partner restaurants on board and thanks
to timely, accurate food deliveries, customer demand is increasing. We've just raised a
round of cash and want to take this to the next level.
The Bad
BizDev has tentatively signed on 5 new partner restaurants. The CEO is looking for metrics
on partner performance to better understand where to invest. The Board is discussing
expanding into more regions over the next 5 years. All are looking to you for a plan.
The Ugly
The systems supporting the three partners had to be customized for each one's different
workflows and business practices. These misalignments lead to mistakes and painful
customer support, risking our company's main competitive advantage in a crowded market.
The dev team is already stretched thin just supporting the three partner restaurants we
already have.
--
We'd like to spend the first 10 minutes with introductions where you can ask questions and
get to know us, the next 45 minutes debating the above scenario and the last 5 minutes for
feedback. That is a lot to ask in a short time, so use your judgment in what you choose to
cover and how to make the most of it.

Good luck, we're thrilled to meet you!

Additional Context
Some initial assumptions you can make to save some time:
1. We already have a basic microservice architecture in place on AWS.
2. We have a fleshed-out web app which customers (individual users) can use to order
food and pay via Stripe. The order fulfillment process is:
a. Our three current partners are small and unsophisticated. We've provided
each with an ipad configured with an email client.
b. Our system sends emails with order details to partner restaurants and delivery
info to a contracted local delivery service.
c. Partner restaurants do not communicate directly with customers. If there are
any changes, problems, or updates to delivery times, the partner emails us
and we handle communication and charge adjustments manually.
d. After delivery, drivers click a special link they received in their email to
confirm. This triggers a Stripe transfer to the partner restaurant.
i. We don't store card numbers or process payments ourselves

3. Menu creation is very high-touch:
a. Our employees go on-site to partner restaurants and take photos.
b. Details are entered into a Google Sheet.
c. An engineer manually runs a script to import the sheet into our database.
d. Changes require manually tweaking the DB or a re-import of the entire sheet.
4. We have minimal analytics.
a. Creating stats require an engineer to run queries by hand.
b. We have a feedback widget on our site, customers generally seem happy.
Most customers make additional orders.
c. Since we only have three partner restaurants and currently maintain a close
relationship with each, we can confidently say they are happy.
d. Though simple, the system itself is quite stable; unexpected downtime is rare."

336,2019-03-13,"I went through a VERY long and complex interview for a HR role in the Los Angeles office. Initially, I spoke with a recruiter over the phone who wanted to know my background and expectations in my next role. The next day, a coordinator reached out to schedule a phone interview with one of the members of the team. The style was very conversational and flowed pretty well. The next step, was to schedule a video interview with another member of the team. By the time I got to this stage, it had already been 3 weeks of speaking to different team members about the role. After spending 45 minutes on the video call, I guess they decided I was good enough to be invited for an onsite panel interview.   The recruiter let me know I would be meeting with 6 different people. 3 of which would be in my panel interview. The next day, I received an email from the hiring manager, with case study questions attached. I was panicked because the recruiter said nothing of a case study. I spent the weekend preparing for my case study and presentations slides. The day of my panel interview arrived, and I was blown away by the office scene. BEAUTIFUL office and amazing vibes! I met with a total of 7 people. 1 person was out of town so I met with them through video call. The panel interview was intense and very thorough. After spending 4 hours onsite, I felt pretty good about my presentation and the impression I left with the hiring manager and team. I was shocked to find the recruiter did not reach back out to me for almost a week. I was told that even though the panel interview was supposed to be the last step int he process, the team just couldn't make a decision. I was requested to have one more final video call with one of the directors within the department. After the final video call, days went by with no communication. After a week, I decided to reach out to the recruiter to check the status. I was then contacted by phone and told that I did NOT get the job. After 7 weeks of interviewing with Netflix, I wasn't even given any real feedback to help me in the future. I even emailed the hiring manger asking for feedback but still nothing. It's very disappointing to know I went through almost 2 months of interviewing and Netflix doesn't even care enough to give valuable feedback to candidates.",Why Netflix?1 AnswerSituational questions1 Answer
337,2019-03-12,"SIGH. Netflix recruiting, I had such high hopes for you. The recruiting team & HR is always praised saying how great each and everyone of you all are. The cutthroat environment of only high-performers made me believe that the recruiting process would be some what of a high caliber interview process. I’m sad and disappointed to say that mine wasn’t. After reaching out to a Director directly, I was sent an interview request from a Researcher. This researcher had less than a year of experience. I was hesitant initially but I thought, hey, it’s Netflix, she must be solid to make it at least that long. Gosh, I was so wrong. The call started 5-6 minutes late. She apologized and laid out the outline for the phone conversation (typical layout: going over your background first, recruiter asks you questions and goes over the position, and question time at the end). First couple minutes through the phone call, I can already tell it’s not going well. Was it me? Or was it her? I can definitely let you know that the tone of the Researcher’s voice already made a statement. She wasn’t interested... not even at a bare minimum. Was she forced to screen me? It sure felt like it. The call was VERY rushed. I get that it was for 30 minutes but calling me late, that’s on you. I asked her questions at the end and you know what a recruiter’s pet peeve is? Not answering the darn question. I asked her about the typical req load and offices that I would recruit for. She only answered the latter. So how are you going to judge me as a recruiter and pass on me when you can’t even do a good job screening me? I’m not sure if she was taught about “candidate experience” but here’s my thing. Most candidates take time to research and prepare for the call, even taking time off as needed from work. At the very least, we want to chat to someone who can act interested so the prep and the time is worth it. One Researcher or a Recruiter can leave a bad taste for a candidate. I hope that they can train their newer teammates better because I would hate for anyone to go through what I did.",What is the most challenging role?Most challenging hiring manager?How many reqs?What type of roles did you recruit for?Why are you looking to leave?
338,2019-03-08,"The hiring manager sent me a message saying that she is really interested in my background and the current role at Netflix perfectly suits my profile. I agreed and she scheduled the phone screening round.  In the phone screening round I was asked three questions, one on coding (merge two sorted arrays), two SQL questions, and describe the steps to build a classifier. When I illustrated the steps he/she asked further questions on describing Logistic Regression in details, describe gradient descent, L1 and L2 norms, if data is sparse what happens, difference between online and batch gradient descent, word embeddings and sentence embeddings.  I thought I did fairly well considering all the questions were expected from a standard data science interview. However, I got a confirmation email from the recruiter that they rejected me saying that the feedback was positive however I am not an appropriate fit for the role. When I asked for further clarification they said they have better candidates than me. Here is my problem is that they connected me saying that I am proper fit.

I was beyond excited for the opportunity until after the first interview.   She called and there was so much wind in the background it sounded as if she was standing under a helicopter. After I asked her to repeat her question for the 2nd time she then said ""I'm sorry can you not hear me?"" ""I couldn't book a conference room, so I was trying to find a quiet place outside"" (this should have been the first flag). She then advised she would email me a new time to reschedule even after I told her I would be free for the day, she insisted on emailing to actually calendar a new interview time. I accepted that and then left to the grocery story. It's about an hour after our call and my phone rings. It's the recruiter asking me if it's still a good time? Not wanting to lose out on the opportunity, I say yest and am forced to interview while pacing back and forth in the parking lot of the grocery store with cars honking and people talking etc. It was awful. She sounded like she just wanted the call to end and had little to no job description for me as she advised it was an ""internal opening""  The call ended with an offered 2nd phone interview with the hiring manager and she advised a recruiter will reach out via email to set up.   Two week go by, I finally get an email for the phone interview and it repeatedly states to review the company culture as they will question us on it heavily.

The entire interview continued on with these very dry questions that he wanted immense detail on. Anything I advised I led my team on, he came back with ""no no, what did you contribute on your own"" Considering a WELL functioning work place usually operates as a team, most of the projects that I led were executed in the end as a team.

391,2018-08-09,"One of the best interview processes in the Bay Area. Clear communication about interview steps, quick turn-around time, sensible interview questions.  One of the things I liked the most about the process is practical interview questions. Netflix won't ask you some algorithms you'll never use in your work. Instead, they will test your real life knowledge of tech you'll be working on, your problem solving skills, and culture-fit.  You usually have a choice between a technical screen and take home exercise.  Take home exercise supposed to take 6-8 hours to finish, while tech screen only takes an hour. If you pass this stage you'll be invited to an on-site interview.  On-site interview has 2 parts - engineering assessment and culture-fit assessment. You'll have ~3 45-mins slots with engineers who will ask you straightforward coding/design questions (usually on a white board). You will also have a slot with a hiring manager. If all goes well you'll go into the second stage of the interview meeting with HR person and likely engineering director of the org you're interviewing for.  It may seem like a lot, but it's well worth it.

The recruiter did not seem bothered that I was asked about areas that would've violated my NDA to answer.  Advice for Netflix: Respect a candidate's NDA.

435,2018-02-27,"I was very excited to apply to Netflix, which is a company I greatly admire as a consumer and the roles defined seemed very well suited to my prior experience.   I had an initial call with the hiring manager to whom my resume was sent by a friend who used to work at Netflix. I thought the call went quite well, he asked me very few questions about my experience but was more interested in questions that I had for him which he answered quite clearly and logically. Thereafter he said he would put me into the process for the role. This part of the experience was very positive and even if this person gave negative feedback on me because of something I said, I would think that was fair game. However I don’t think that was the case, I believe I was turned down by their HR / Talent acquisition team without any real basis and I felt the way that I was treated was unprofessional.   Thereafter I received an email from a recruiter in their Talent Acquisition team in Singapore - we scheduled a call for the next day. I logged on to the dial in on time and after waiting 10 minutes, tried the recruiters landline to see what was up. She said “oh I was just about to call you”. She then called me back and started out by asking me a very basic question about my experience in management consulting (even though this ended more than 5 years ago).   A bit of context here, I had already taken time off work for the first call with the hiring manager, and was therefore unable to do so for this subsequent call with the recruiter. Therefore I scheduled time after another meeting I had outside my current office, and had decided to take the call from a Starbucks that is very centrally located.   When I set about answering her question, the network on my cellphone suddenly started acting up in a big way and the call dropped 6 times while I was responding. She called me back several times but we kept having the same issue. After this, she didn’t call back and so I attempted to call her on her landline, but got no answer. A few seconds after this I received an email from her saying it was great chatting with me and have a good week. I responded by apologising about the network issues and asking if we could reschedule our call since we didn’t get a chance to speak properly. I received no response to this message.   A week later, she emailed me again saying she enjoyed speaking with me, and unfortunately my background is not a fit though they will keep my resume on file in case there are suitable roles going forward.   Aside from being disappointed at being rejected, I am left feeling that Netflix’s talk about their culture is lip service - they claim to be humble (which the hiring manager was), but the HR persons behaviour was arrogant - from joining the call late, to the content of her email and lack of response to my request for a reschedule, and later rejecting my application. Netflix claims to be a company that prides itself on making “informed” decisions - though this clearly does not apply to the talent acquisition team.",Describe your experience in consulting?

478,2017-07-13,"Netflix is the hottest company in Hollywood to work for. Problem is...they know it.  So, when they're interviewing you, they like to play games.  I was applying for a Coordinator position in their Unscripted Originals department, a position that I was more than qualified for being that I've worked in this space for the past 8 years at numerous production companies and networks. Was emailed on a Friday by one of their recruiters to set a phone interview for that Monday. Therefore, I spent the weekend watching all of their shows, studying the backgrounds of all key Netflix staff members and reviewing the unscripted television marketplace. Needless to say, I was 100% prepared.  But, unfortunately, all the recruiter seemed to care about was if I had reviewed their ""culture deck"" and what my thoughts were about it.  Every time I tried to display my knowledge of the space and how my unique skill-set can be of value to their company, she kept going back to this culture deck and grilling me about what SPECIFICALLY I liked about the deck – apparently she wanted a more detailed answer. It was very odd, it was like she was testing me to see if I really read this (irrelevant) deck.  I’ll be honest, I skimmed through the culture deck, which was by the way, just some generic 100 slide slideshow talking about what Netflix stands for (which was pretty much what any company stands for).  I got off the phone and felt really defeated.  Seemed like this portion of the interview process was ONLY a test to see if you really read their culture deck.  I guess that’s more important than actually being qualified for the position at hand.

479,2017-07-10,"First thing to know, Netflix's corporate structure different than other entertainment companies. A good rule of thumb, consider a position that is one level down from where you are currently. You're title may change but your compensation (I'm told) will not.  Second, read the culture deck and be prepared to talk about it.   From the recruiter/HR side of the hiring process, the experience was mostly positive and I felt supported throughout. They always made themselves available for questions and would almost immediately follow-up a missed phone call with an email. For those I met within the department I was interviewing for, it was hit or miss. I noticed a couple of discrepancies between what the company preached (i.e. the culture deck) and the responses I got from the people I interviewed with. For example, the Netflix culture deck explains how they're seeking ""high-achievers"" ""go-getters."" So imagine my confusion when the response to  my question, ""What are you looking for in a colleague?"" resulted in the response, ""Someone who is chill."" Other individuals I met with would ask me about the culture deck with a sense of ire and sarcastic tone, as if it was an inside joke.  I also thought it odd to interview with someone who was just starting their second day on the job because even they didn't seem to know what the responsibilities of the position were.   From phone interview to final in-person meetings, the whole process took about 2 months. Based on my perception, I was fairly certain that I had the job. I felt that if at any point I wasn’t a good fit, I would have immediately been told and not kept waiting.

Instead of simply granting or refusing my request -- either of which I would have been completely fine with -- he set out to discredit me.  First he checked Netflix's system to see if I had applied before. I had not applied, but a Netflix recruiter had previously contacted me about a position that did not fit my experience. I had declined that opportunity, but suggested I may be a better fit for a more senior position that was open in another department. The recruiter passed my resume to that team, but they felt I was not the right fit, so the exchange concluded there. I never had any communication with that team, so had no occasion to discuss my qualifications or objectives.  The hiring manager I e-mailed -- who is not connected to the aforementioned department -- claimed that I had insisted on a group management position. He said he felt uncomfortable about that . Not only did I never demand such a thing, I found it suspicious that he could freely break confidentiality to enter the system, look at personal records, and make false assumptions about a matter he had not been at all involved in.  Second, he tracked down two colleagues from a previous employer and asked them about me. These were not people I had given as references, and at no time did he ask if this would be acceptable. The people he contacted had been in my department,  but had minimal involvement in my projects, so would have had little knowledge of my work.  He used this as another reason to discredit me.  The hiring manager ultimately offered to schedule a phone call so I could essentially defend myself. I saw no reason to absolve myself to this person, nor was I desperate for a Netflix job, so I wrote back questioning the professionalism of his actions and declined.  If I had provided references to HR as part of a formal interview process, and HR had conducted a background check, I would have understand. But this was a simple e-mail exchange that could have been amicably concluded with a simple ""yes"" or ""no.""

And why i want to join Netflix1 Answer
489,2017-05-21,"I submitted my application via the Netflix jobs site in the evening on a Wednesday, and received an email from a recruiter Monday morning (5 days later) inquiring if I was available to chat.  The recruiter and I set up time for 8 days after their initial email (this was because of a holiday weekend, otherwise, we might have connected sooner).  They gave me a link to the standard Netflix culture slides, which I reviewed in advance of the call.    *1st Interview* The recruiter was interested in what I was currently doing, so I spoke to my background and my interest in the position.  I mentioned that I had some irons in the fire, as I was looking at multiple jobs at the time, and was anticipating movement/offers.  The recruiter assured me that Netflix moves very quickly (I found this to be true).  We chatted for about 25-30 minutes.  I followed-up with the recruiter two days later and they replied that they would like me to speak with the hiring manager by phone.  We set up a 45-minute time slot for the following day.  *2nd Interview* The hiring manager was a great guy, and we shared a pleasant chat for about 40 minutes.  He was able to give me even deeper insight into the team.  Similar to Interview #1, I spoke to my background and qualifications.  I followed-up with the recruiter after Interview #2 and they responded to me in the morning, three days later, letting me know that I had moved on to a more technical call with one of the team.  *3rd Interview* My technical interview was with a data engineer on the team.  This guy had pretty strong SQL chops.  For the first 15 minutes, we spoke about the technologies that I used day-to-day, and whether I utilized any data which changed daily.  Then, we dug into a CollabEdit shared screen on the computer and he gave me some SQL problems to solve.  The 1st question wasn't too difficult; as I recall, it was a pretty straightforward SELECT query with maybe one or two JOINS.  He asked me how I would handle NULLs in the data; I replied that we could utilize IS NOT NULL.  He asked me if there was any other way to do this.  I replied that we could utilize the NVL statement.  He seemed satisfied with this.  The 2nd problem threw me for a loop.  In hindsight, it probably wasn't that hard, but I ended up with a swing and a miss.  It had to do with a SELECT query involving percentages.  It involved some interesting subquerying and aliasing, too, so make sure that you are really familiar with these concepts.  The examples also used terms from the real Netflix world (e.g., streaming times) so if you are familiar with that world, it helps.  Finally, he asked me how I would rate my Python skills, and how I would transfer 1 TB of data (I think that this question is addressed in CtCI).  I asked him a couple of questions, and that was it.  The recruiter let me know two days later in the evening that I hadn't moved on.",How would you handle NULLs when querying a data set?

503,2017-03-21,"I interviewed in person with 4 recruiters and a senior manager in the group I would be recruiting for.  Almost everyone I met is very new to Netflix and barely there for a year.  I got the sense that each person interpreted ""freedom and responsibility"" differently.  They emphasized the work atmosphere as high performing, non micro-managing, and an active feedback culture.  However when I asked each of them to give me examples of feedback they have received, the responses appeared to show a ""micromanaged"" environment.  One recruiter said another teammate told him to not reply all to emails because he was stepping on her toes.  I received feedback as well, noting that I should respond to all recruiting emails with ""a thank you and that I received the email"".  My understanding was that I would receive feedback that would help me improve as a recruiter, i.e. providing context about the bigger picture, not about irrelevant day to day issues.  They boast a year long maternity leave policy, but 2 interviewers, who were pregnant were both taking less than 6 months.  My assumption is that the benefit is all for branding and that anyone that actually takes the full time off would probably get blacklisted in the firm. The senior manager had an impressive background, and he definitely showed it.  He came in late and didn't make a ton of eye contact.  He said he partners with recruiting but acted like I was wasting his time.  He loved to interrupt the interview process with his own thoughts and would stop me mid way to ask follow up questions when I hadn't even finished my initial answers.   He basically told me so far they've tried everything possible to recruit and it's still very difficult to attract talent.  Overall, the recruiting process was a bit disjointed, but that isn't out of the ordinary for a firm with so many new people.

534,2016-09-29,"The overall process was okay, the in-person interview was a bit frustrating because I could tell the hiring managers only wanted to hear what they thought was correct.  In the interview they asked a number of open-ended questions that generally observe a candidates' analytical reasoning, and solution identification process.  However, I could tell the hiring managers had certain answers in mind and were looking for you to say word for word what was already in their mind.

Asks me about preventing deadlocks and ends up saying I could prevent it in a certain way and he forgot that I had already mentioned that solution to him at the beginning.  Small coding question on multithreading - probably 7 lines of code - which I ended up getting right with a little bit of help.  There were 15mins left and he jumps to check if I had any questions for him making me wonder whether he was done asking me stuff.  I start asking him questions about the team/project/challenges.  Then suddenly jumps back to ask me some more technical questions regarding how I'd handle operations. Answered everything fine I thought.  Ended up getting same email from them about not having the perfect background.  Anyways, probably the most haphazard phone screen I've had in my career as the interviewer lacked structure.

538,2016-09-15,"Had an employee referral and also applied online. After about a week or two I received an email from a recruiter to schedule a phone call. We spoke on the phone for about 30 minutes. She was very thorough with her questions and definitely seemed to understand the position, the requirements and the company very well. She then emailed me the same day to schedule another phone interview with the department head. That interview went even better. Again was asked a lot of the same questions but this time the interviewer talked a lot more and was very inviting so we had a great 30 minute phone call. A day or two later I was asked to come in for an in person interview. I met with 4 people: a different recruiter (not from my phone interview), the department head, another supervisor from the department and someone who works in a department that I would be working closely with. Each interview was scheduled for 30 minutes. Each one asked the same questions I had already been asked in both my phone interviews. It was pretty boring and very repetitive. I felt like even if we didn't have 30 minutes of conversation to be had they made sure to stick around the full 30 minutes. The recruiter was much more focused on the company culture, the others a bit more on the actual department and position. The company culture and their 100+ page deck is a bit much. I followed up a few days later via email and one week after my interview received a voicemail saying that they went with someone else. I was 90% sure I was going to get the job since I had gotten so far in the interview process, had an employee referral and was totally confident I could handle the work efficiently.

Then 1 technical phone screen, it covered a fair amount knowledge that's relevant to the job, as well as a coding exercise via collabedit. The interviewer was kind enough to send me feedback directly afterward upon request, candid feedback is real here.  Then first onsite round, 2 technical interviewers and 2 management interviewers. I ended up stopped here due to my technical skills not meeting the need. The technical questions asked were fair given they are very frank about looking for experienced candidate, it's natural that some questions you just can't answer because you haven't deal with those problems before or haven't used a certain aspect of a language.

549,2016-07-25,"Firstly, the interview process at Netflix will vary greatly by team because at Netflix, you are interviewing for a specific position (not to ""just get into the company""), and each team manages their interviewing process.  Fair or not, this means you could have two technical interviews or four.  It also means that the total number of interviews may differ.  That said, as pointed out in at least one other interview review your interview process will most likely be split up into two parts.  Get a thumbs up from the first part, and you go to the second.  If you get a thumbs down, please understand that your interviews are over and your process will not continue.  If you live locally, they typically break this up into two separate days.  If they fly you in from out of town, they will all be in one day.  If you are from out of town, I would stress making sure you pace yourself.  Your last rounds of interviews will most likely be your hardest and will be with members of the management chain above your hiring manager.  There should be no surprises when you decide to interview for Netflix.  Their slide deck is public and you are essentially encouraged at every turn to study it.  If you don't agree with the slide deck and the Netflix philosophy, then don't apply or don't continue the process.  No one is forcing you.  Netflix IS the slide deck.  Should you chose to interview, you are acknowledging that you understand and support the Netflix culture and all that it entails.  You would be wise to study the side deck and culture and know it and how it relates to you because the cultural questions you will be asked will relate directly to that.  As every team is different, the cultural questions will be different and will depend entirely on the candidate.  I was told you couldn't really prepare for them as either you would either be viewed as a good fit and would do well in the Netflix culture or you would not.  The only advice I can offer in this area is know yourself and know it well.  Know your strengths and weaknesses.  Know how they tie into the culture and be ready to discuss them.  You will be given scenarios to which you will need to respond and knowing yourself, your strengths, and your weaknesses inside and out will allow you to respond fluidly.  Above all, be yourself.",There wasn't just one difficult question.  Just know that you will be asked scenario type questions and knowing your strengths and weaknesses and how they tie into the Netflix culture slides.
550,2016-07-25,"To apply, I only had to attach my resume and answer about ten very basic questions (Am I an American citizen? Have I ever been convicted of a felony?) About a week later, I received an e-mail asking me to perform a video interview.   This was the most stressful aspect of the interview process, because a video interview is not something I've ever done before and I'm not super comfortable talking to a webcam without a live person on the other end. The interview was 30 questions long and about 7 of those involved filming myself answering pretty typical interview questions (ex: Why do you want to work at Netflix? Describe your ideal job. Describe a time you set a goal for yourself and how you accomplished it.) It also asked me to role play walking a customer through an issue, by reading the steps that would need to be taken without sounding robotic. During the video part, keep in mind your body language, tone of voice and not using filler words such as ""um"" or ""like"". But also keep it natural and relaxed.   Interspersed with that were timed multiple choice questions that tested your computer literacy (ex: what is the quick key way to close an open tab? when a cursor is hovering over a word or object and it turns into a hand, what does that mean?) and also several timed reading comprehension questions. These were the most difficult part of the interview, because it has several paragraphs describing a Netflix policy like billing cycles on the left side and you are supposed to read the policy and then pick the multiple choice answer on the right that best summarizes the policy (all of which are very similarly worded, so you need to read them carefully.) It doesn't sound that difficult but you are only given 90 seconds to both read the policy and then read and choose the best answer. If you are a slower reader like me, it can be a challenge.  Two weeks after completing the video interview, I received an e-mail asking to set up a live interview where I would still be interviewing over webcam but with a live person on the other end. This interview was painless and just worked like an ordinary job interview. The questions I was asked were mostly about my resume, so they seem to ask more personally tailored questions at this point. I would recommend knowing your job history, why you left or pursued different jobs and also keeping in mind examples of how you behaved under challenging circumstances at those jobs.   I go into my final face-to-face interview this week, so we'll see how it goes. I hope this review helps someone else who is applying for this position, as it is very different from any other interview process I've ever had and also takes a long time to complete (it's been almost 6 weeks, at this point).

I was very happy about this because usually companies refrain from giving candidates direct feedback. Based on the feedback I'm certain that the meeting with the last director cost me the job. This is unfortunate, because Netflix seems to be a great company to work for, and the people are great. My biggest tip is that when you interview, make sure to stay focused all the way through. Every interview counts - including the last two director interviews which seem to be more easy going but are crucial just the same. Another important tip that I received feedback on is to show passion and enthusiasm about the company and about the role. They are looking for people who are really ""into""  the domain the company is in and in the specific domain of the role. If you don't show enthusiasm they'll not hire you!","Given a binary search tree find the kth smallest element.3 Answersgiven a set of tasks with dependency between them.Schedule the tasks.

578,2016-02-12,"I felt the interview process was very fair, and they are considerate of your time, in that they move pretty fast. There were a total of 9 people I spoke to, including the executives who really try their best to understand if you fit in their culture.  The time during the tech rounds was used very effectively, and the person who interviewed me actually took pictures of my code to review later. That shows, that the interviewers really want to be thorough in the screening process. Unlike many other companies, Netflix does not waste too much in trying to understand what you did previously. They assess that from your resume, and the first telephone round with the hiring manager. So all of their tech interviews were 100% focused on finding if you have the skills to do the job you are interviewing for.  Likewise, from what I understand, Netflix does not hire generalists. They only hire specialists.  The hiring manager was always to the point, and answered all of the questions I had around the tech stack and their culture with a high degree of honesty. He also kept encouraging me to be honest with all of my interviewers. I felt a great vibe from him and his team, and was very motivated to join them. None of his team members looked stressed, on the contrary they all seemed very passionate about their job.   I agree with some of the reviews here about how Netflix’s recruiters keep telling you that no one rejects Netflix based on their compensation. But this was never told to me in a  haughty way. It was more in a matter of fact way or in a “we take pride” way, and after actually seeing their compensation, I feel they have every reason to take pride. The recruiters came across as very warm and kept me promptly informed with the outcome of every step in the interview process, without me having had to follow-up with them. In other words, the entire process was extremely efficient. Unfortunately I could not take their offer for a reason that had nothing to do with them, but I can easily see them as my future employer.",I cannot disclose them here for confidentiality reasons.1 Answer
579,2016-02-06,"Mostly a negative experience all said and done. It's a cast of B players who're looking for more like them, it seems. There's a crazy emphasis on culture that it almost felt cult like. The HR people are held up on a very high pedestal - to reinforce the cultural adherence, I guess. If you're not into cults, maybe you should stay away from this place.","I met two HR people (can’t remember their titles now, but they they sounded high and lofty), one recruiter, three software engineers, the manager of the team and their director.

Both the HR ladies gave a nice monologue about their culture and how great and unique it is. They didn’t really ask me much. This has to be the only place I’ve interviewed at that puts HR on such a high pedestal.

The technical interview questions were a mixed bag. The first guy wanted me to implement a ReadWrite lock. Which I did. I love concurrency design patterns. I wanted to engage more and talk about RCU locks or fairness in lock acquisition or cool ways of avoiding deadlocks in code, but the interviewer just looked away every time I said something that (I can only guess) felt like I was veering off his script. Ok, whatever. 

The second technical guy’s question was a loosely defined problem of maintaining a distributed counter. I did my best to come up with a reasonable answer. The parameters of the problem were not really defined that well. Can the system be inconsistent or not? Does the system have to be available or not? I ended up designing a CRDT type (accidentally) for him, as I fumbled along. I got the sense that he didn’t know distributed systems well enough to articulate the problem in a way someone who’s not a mind reader could understand.

The third technical guy asked about implementing a hashmap and computing the max of an n-ary tree. Both relatively easy problems. I solved both in what I thought was a reasonable amount of time. He was by far the nicest person amongst all of them. He had actually looked at my resume and complimented me on it. Which I thought was really decent of him. None of the other people had even so much as made an effort to look at my resume.

After that, I met with the director of the team. The director didn’t seem all that interested in being there. I can’t remember him asking me anything substantial about my work or telling me about his team’s work. I’m not sure if he cared I joined or not. Culture came up a lot, again.

The final interview was with the manager of the team, the next day. He was remote, so we had to do it over a google hangout. This was by far the worst interview. He told me that the interview feedback from the previous day was positive, but one consistent feedback was that I was a “low energy guy”. Huh? I felt like Donald Trump had just hurled an insult at me. What is that even supposed to mean. I marched on regardless. Then he sent me a diagram via email of boxes (supposed to be their client devices) connected to a cloud with a question mark in it to more boxes (supposed to be the blackened boxes holding movies). And he said “how would you solve this”. Solve what? For the next 20 minutes, I struggled to understand what the problem being asked of me to “solve” was. I asked what I thought were pertinent questions. What’s the update rate on the backend boxes. His answer: “let’s say lots… high”. Me: “how high?”. Him: “let’s say 500 an hour”. Me: “that’s kind of low”. Him: “but how would you solve this”. Me (thinking): “what’s “this””. Me: “What’s the expected latency from the time someone requests something to the time you have to deliver it?”. Him: “it doesn’t matter, how would you solve this”. Me (thinking): “Arrrggh”. On and on it went and I could not understand what “this” was. The more he spoke, the more I thought, oh boy this is just the kind of guy you don’t want as a manager.

The next day they told me that they had decided not to continue. It wasn’t an unexpected response after that “interview” with the the manager. Good riddance.2 Answers"
580,2016-01-29,"I met several Netflix employees at conference where I had a good chance to get to know them. The manager reached out to me a few times that he thought I would be a good fit for his team and I finally agreed to do a video screen with one of the engineers which went pretty well. They then flew me out to Los Gatos for an onsite which lasted about 5 hours. The technical part of the interview, while challenging, was all relevant to my experience and the position. My initial fear was that there'd be some sort of non-relevant engineering questions such as ""explain the role of b-trees in modern databases"" or some such nonsense that some companies like the ask but bear no relevance to the role. Refreshingly, all of the technical questions centered around the technologies and languages that I'd actually be using in a UI role (i.e. Javascript & CSS).   Once I made it through the technical portions of the interview, I met with various directors of departments that I would be working with if I were hired. This part of the interview was the most difficult as they ask questions that try to identify if you're a good culture fit and whether or not you'd be a good person to work with. Essentially, Netflix doesn't just care if you can code; They care if you're an all around intelligent and good natured person and as they mentioned several times, they will not hire ""brilliant jerks.""   A point of advice: you can't fake your way through this interview. While I was ready for standard culture questions (what are you greatest strengths, weaknesses, etc), almost all of the questions were ones you couldn't prepare for. For instance, ""If you ran your own company, how would you align the objectives of perfect design and flawless engineering?"" There were a lot of questions like that which really dug deep into who I was as an engineer and because all of the questions were open ended, there was no way to fake it and tell them the answer they were looking for. I realized that at the end of the day, it's not personal: either you're a culture fit or you're not. Netflix is a 60 billion dollar company with less than 2500 employees due to the fact that everyone is very intelligent and highly aligned so they have a good idea of what works and what doesn't.   Needless to say, at the end of the day my brain was mush. I had given open, honest answers but everyone was pretty poker-faced so I figured that I had failed the culture fit portion. But on the other hand, I had gotten through the technical portion so I was pretty proud of that. I was surprised by a phone call the next day stating that Netflix wanted to make me an offer but they wouldn't tell me compensation information as they didn't want it to influence my decision. Essentially, they determined that I was a good fit for Netflix but I needed to decide if Netflix was a good fit for me. In retrospect, I really appreciated them not being pushy and making sure it was the right choice for me. I was a little leery of accepting an offer with no salary information but in the end those fears were unfounded as the compensation package was very generous.    In conclusion, it was a fantastic interview process and the rumors of Netflix's compensation being top of market are absolutely true.",Standard JavaScript/CSS questions which weren't too bad if you knew your stuff.1 Answer
581,2016-01-29,"My interview process began with a phone call with an engineering manager to chat about the position and the team that I would be joining. I then went on to do a technical phone screen and an on-site after that. The technical phone-screen was a practical question and the on-site took a full day with a technical session followed by a session focused on behavioral aspects (e.g. experience interacting with product / design and perspective on the business).  The whole day was long and the questions were challenging. Also having read the culture deck before the interview, I was very nervous about how those points play out in real life. Throughout the process though I was impressed with all the interviewers I spoke to and their candor about what it was like to work at Netflix was much appreciated.  Overall I believe the interview process was appropriately difficult and the interview panel as a whole was able to give me a good picture of what working at Netflix would look like.",What is your experience working with product managers and designers?1 Answerwhat about the team you're interviewing for interests you?Have you read the culture deck and what does it mean to you?

They definitely practice age discrimination, which is something I never want to see as a recruiter. The lady I spoke with flat out told me they look to hire senior people and don't have an internship program because they don't care to invest in new talent - they want people to come in and hit the ground running. It's supposedly part of their ""culture"" but to me seems like a great way to alienate Generation Y, which is poised to become the majority in the workforce over the next few years. It's just not strategic or competitive from a recruiting standpoint. She also went into their ""freedom and responsibility"" idea, which is basically saying it's everyone for themselves and good luck finding a sincere mentor over there.   I sent her an email after doing my research about why I'm passing on the opportunity, but I doubt that'll change anything.

583,2016-01-14,"I submitted my application online and got a phone to set up a phone interview two or three days after I applied. I was sent an email to complete which covered typing, tech knowledge, and grammer. The phone interview is more of a general Q&A about work experience and how you respond to customers. When you are speaking to the recruiter make sure to use ""the STAR method"" when responding to behavior based questions. I passed the first step in the process. They invited me out to an interview at the call center. Note the interview really does take 2 hours. The first part of the interview you listen to other agents on the phone. After that you pull into a meeting room and do group role playing. After that I did another interview one on one. One of the interview questions was my attendance record. When I said I was only late twice in the last year the interviewer didn't like the answer. I told him that it was because of  the snow. (Keep in mind I live in Utah) he looked dumbfounded.  He asked how I could have not been late. My response was leave my house earlier. He still looked very confused. After going through that process I knew I didn't have the job but I wanted to write in here for those of you who want the job.

585,2016-01-09,"Summary: Netflix seems to be an awesome place to work at. Everyone I talked to seemed like a top performer and also seem to make every effort to keep their culture in line with what they have published publically. I am one of those guys who calls BS when he reads culture decks because in my experience once a company grows beyond certain point, every team defines its own culture but Netflix seemed like an exception and I wish every company could embress or at least imbibe what they have culturally.   Even though I don't anticipate an offer my recommendation is to focus more on questions that you generally expect from HR and managers. Those are the tough ones and as engineer I think many of us do poorly in this area. Things that we should definitely know but are hard to express. For example the questions like Why Netflix? What do you want from your ideal job? What is the best environment for you to be successful? I am sure in your head you know what it is but make an effort to verbalize it. They are trying to judge if you will fit with a unique culture that they have worked so hard to develop and preserve and your technical ability is important but still not as important(or at least as important) as their culture.    * A call with recruiter to align my interests with position * A call with director to I guess vet the basic culture fit * A call with manager , again for both basic culture fit and technical assessment  * A technical phone screen. * Onsite:      Recruiter: Culture fit and making sure I understand how they are different from most companies.              Dev manager: Explained what the team does in more details , described what is expected of the person who would join the team, the challenges and the road map that he has for the team. Overall he did everything in his power to give me as much information possible as he can to make the right decision if they extended an offer.            Sr. Engineer: Describe one of the challenging problems you have solved and discussed the design decisions I made. Pretty awesome guy and he was smart so it was very stimulating discussion, for a second I forgot I am interviewing. He asked a coding question which was something that lot of us have to use in real life not one of those trick questions.           Dev manager/engineer from a sister team: Again awesome guy. Asked a system design question. Again we had a discussion that you expect to have when designing a solution with your teammates. He brought up some good points and I change my design accordingly. The biggest mistake I made was mathematical (confused gb with mb iirc) but he did not really point that out and let me focus on the crux of the problem.  At this point I was given a lunch break and I was told in the beginning that I will have 3 more rounds depending on how the first 4 round goes. I am not sure what it means if you get to next round, it can either mean there was not enough evidence to reject you or it can mean there is enough evidence to keep going but we can all just guess. Anyhow, if you don't go beyond this point , please understand that you have been rejected. I was given the opportunity to move forward.      Director: This was the second hardest interview for me. She talked about projects where i had slipped the delivery dates and what i have done to rectify those situation. I think I failed to verbalize things correctly but overall she tried to extract as much info as she could to figure out my personality and working style.     Sr. Director: Talked about a challenging design problem and how netflix was a pretty awesome place to work at. Also enquired about the reason for leaving , how netflix will be different or not for those reasons. Again I believe this was culture fit assessment.      VP: This was my worst interview of the day. May be because I was tired, may be because the VP just somehow felt intimidating, I am not sure. He asked me to tell him what feedbacks my colleagues might give about me. It was more of a wake up call for me that I really did not have much to say in this regard until ofcourse the interview was over. He also discussed one of the projects on my resume and how I would have changed things.  Overall I was very happy with the interview process. I hate interviews where you don't endup learning anything and unless you get an offer it becomes one wasted day. This was different. Given my poor responses in the final 3 rounds I don't anticipate an offer but I hope others learn from my mistakes. The key is to think hard about these culture questions that you probably think you know the answers to but don't know how to communicate to others. Good luck.","What feedback would your peers give you if you ask them for some criticism?

601,2015-10-18,"The interview process at Netflix was fun and incredibly efficient. I got an offer form them, but for personal reasons I had to reject it. I definitely recommend everyone to try and get into this amazing company.  I applied to several positions through their website and they got in touch with me. In less than one week I had the opportunity to talk to the recruiter and the hiring manager. I had great conversation with both of them and the position in the Build&Tolols team seemed a good match for me. They sent me a coding exercise which gave me the opportunity not only to show my coding skills but also to show how I would handle a real life project, with build and test code. At this point, I got an offer from Amazon and asked them if they could expedite the process. They were extremely efficient and flew me to Los Gatos in a couple days.   The onsite interview was amazing. I had three technical interviews where I could discuss the problems they were working on, my past experience and my open source projects. The people interviewing me were the people I would work with, including my hiring manager. I also had the opportunity to ask all I wanted about Netflix amazing and peculiar culture. It is a little bit frightening that they let people with adequate performance go, but after talking to them I realised that was the reason they got such an amazing team.  After having lunch with the team, which was composed by a bunch of nice and smart guys, I went back for one more round of interviews, this time with the Netflix directors. This was a very good sign since you only take this second round of interviews if you went well at the first round. We had very interesting conversations in which they seemed to be assessing me in terms of culture. It all went great and I got to learn more about the company.  After all interviews were over, my hiring manager showed me the area where my team worked. I even got a few stickers and a mini figure of Chaos Monkey! He told me that the team really loved me and he would get back to me soon. Because I had a pending offer from Amazon, they called me back the same day to tell me I had passed and to try to and get me to say no to Amazon :) They made an offer with flying colours! Given the fact I loved the team, the work I would do and the company culture, I said a very happy yes.   After a couple weeks, when I was already preparing for relocation, I got a call from Google. I had an interview with them some time ago and they also had an offer for me. Even though the opportunity at Google didn't sound as appealing as the one at Netflix, I wouldn't need to relocate to Los Gatos and that was very important to me and my family. I had to cancel with my team at Netflix, which made me feel really bad since I had such an amazing experience with the people there. Even though this was not the right time for me to join Netflix, I would be more than happy to get in touch with them in the future to explore more opportunities.",They asked many behavioural questions in order to make sure I would be a good fit for they peculiar culture of freedom and responsibility.1 Answer

Mentioning that I was still interviewing elsewhere in case this didn't work out seemed to be a mistake, something HR and the VP brought up multiple times, although this contradicted their culture deck.  He also mentioned tons of bureaucratic rules and regulations that were again, something the culture deck was trying to say made them different from companies like IBM, Apple, etc., but he more or less up front said they're the same.    I figured since I love working on projects on the side that do not compete with the business, and constantly look for outside the box solutions that working on side projects bring, it would be a good fit culturally, but I guess I was wrong.",What would one of your colleagues say is your biggest weakness?

618,2015-07-29,"I filled out a short application online. I received an email about two weeks later asking me to do some tests including, grammar, typing and technical test. You also had to do this weird thing were you had to either take a video of yourself answering some questions or have a automated voice call. Warning: if you do the automated voice, you have hardly any instructions on how to proceed and I did horribly.   Somehow, I passed that part of the hiring process and was emailed for a phone interview. This was pretty standard and just be yourself. It was about 10-15 minutes and I was asked to come in for an interview. Make sure you ask what you need to bring. In my case, they told me to come dressed casual and to be 10 minutes early and to BRING TWO FORMS OF ID.   I showed up and met with some other interviewees, most of which were great and full of energy. This interview lasted about two hours and here is how it went down.   -The recruiter and two Netflixcs employees were in the interview. The first thing asked was what is our favorite show or movie and how to we enjoy it.  -There was a small slideshow deal and then we were asked to roleplay. Basically, the recruiter made up a scenario for each individual and the individual had to act like the owner of a business while the recruiter was the customer.  -After the first roleplay, we had to do a second round of roleplay questions. In this roleplay, the two Netflixcs employees would give each individual feedback and you were to implement it into the second roleplay scenario. Now, this is something I found a bit strange. Almost everyone had negative feedback but me and another person. They said I did a great job and really didn't offer much else. This roleplay was a netflix specific scenario and you had to go up on a laptop in front of everyone and ""take a call"". I nailed it, or so I thought. I didn't sound scripted, I sounded confident and knowledable. It was all around, a good customer experience.  -After this last roleplay, we were told that they were going to step out and talk, then pull each of us out for a chat. I was one of the first few called out and I knew this was probably not a good sign. The recruiter didn't even take me in another room, she literally walked me out the door and said ""we are just pulling people out and letting them know we will have a decision in a few days.""   Now, I understand that I may not fit the role that Netflixcs is wanting for employees. What I don't understand and what I find as an insult to my intelligence is everything that happened in the last minute after I left the room full of people. You ask us to bring two forms of ID but somehow you are now needing a few days to discuss it? Don't be a coward and just be honest with people. We are all adults and should be treated with a basic level of respect.   This really told me a lot about how working at Netflixcs might be, and I don't believe I would have been a good fit with the lack of professionalism on their part that has taken place as soon as leaving the group interview. I still haven't gotten the courtesy email or phone call the recruiter said I would get when walking out the door.

Standard questions about past experience and what the position entailed.

These are where I got asked standard interview questions, but felt when I was talking to the HR rep, that she was looking for certain answers (see the culture deck).    This is where things got strange in my opinion.  I was escorted to a smaller conference room and met with a member of the marketing team.

I was very disappointed with the interviewer. Initially the interviewer was late with the phone call. After apologizing to me I was asked about my experience and background. The interviewer misread my resume asking me about places that I worked in the past that the interviewer thought I was currently working at. After talking a bit more, I was told that I needed a laptop or PC to continue with the process and do some practice testing. This would have been good information to have before hand. Definitely not something to spring on a candidate during the actual interview. Unlike my first couple of phone screens in which the interviewer's questions were clear and concise, this interviewer's questions were not very defined or well organized. To top everything off, the interviewer had a heavy accent that was very difficult to understand via telephone, especially at times when the interviewer was mumbling in a low voice (or seemed distracted). Given everything, the interviewer was clearly not prepared for the interview and probably not 100% qualified to give a proper one given how disorganized and unprepared the interviewer was.   It's a very unfortunate situation because good candidates are the ones that get disqualified for positions like these because the interviewer isn't prepared or qualified to screen candidates.

I have plenty of child care support and am available to step up and work full time hours when needed and on short notice.  I made it clear child care and the fact that the job was a lower level of what I had last done was a non-issue.

Next I had a phone call with the two department heads. That was supposed to last about half an hour, but was only about 15 minutes. It was in this conversation I was able to get a better grasp of the position and what they were looking for, while discussing my skill set and how it complements the job at hand. After following up, I was asked to provide times I would be available for an in-person interview. I was scheduled to meet with 4 people for 30 minutes each, the last of which was a recruiter up in Los Gatos, so we did a video conference. The interview went the full 2 hours which is kind of exhausting. Overall, I felt it went well and got along with everyone and seemed to be anticipating what they needed. One of the issues seemed to be that Netflix prides itself on not a lot of ""process"" and this position was going to be very process-driven. They expressed that they were taking their time looking because it was a new position and they wanted to find the exactly right person for the position and to fit in personality-wise. I guess I was not that person because I heard back from a Netflix recruiter about 3 days later that although I ""had positive feedback, it's unfortunately not going to a be quite the perfect match for the role that we have today.""","What excites you about working for Netflix?We have some time left in our session, do you have any questions for me?

When I politely asked her if she could turn off the speaker phone, she became terse and annoyed. I could tell the recruiter was very distracted. Afterward, I felt confident that their corporate mission theory did not match their actual practice as I have never had such an unprofessional phone screen in my life.

I believe this interview went well.  The second in-person interview was with the Android developer I spoke with on the phone. He wanted me to use the white board to describe the architecture I came up with for my previous project. He then asked questions about it - why I implemented things the way I did. I believe that this interview went well.  The third in-person interview was where it all started to fall apart. He did not introduce himself. He sat down without shaking hands or making eye contact. I then also sat down and he pushed a piece of paper in my face with C++ code. The first task was to figure out a variable scope problem.

Afterward, using the same code, he wanted me to give the output to the log - there were several ""printlog()"" statements at specific sections of a class: constructor and static block. This guy's job was to test knowledge corner cases.  The fourth in-person interview was on : 1) on the white-board, show a class that implements a stack with infinite depth (using a linked-list) 2) write a recursive function that solves the equation X[n] = X[n-1] + X[n-2] where X is an array that contains at least two integer values and the function should solve the question for the 3rd value in the array. 3) THE SALAD TEST!! This is some weird psycho test where he brings in two salads and asks you to choose one. Note1: this interview will take place during lunch hour. Note2: he won't eat with you, he'll watch !! Even though I complained about being uncomfortable about this situation (and was pushing the salad away!) he insisted ""No, you go eat!"".

729,2014-01-22,"I was contacted by Netflix asking if I was interested in a position with the company. After emailing back, the recruiter sent me a description for the Director of Product Innovation in Los Gatos, California. She also sent me a very long slideshow about the company's work philosophy. I had one phone interview with the young recruiter who was fresh out of college, and it seemed to go well. She said she'd let me know in a week if they wanted to schedule a second interview. It was right before the winter holiday break, so I assumed it would take longer. Well, I followed up with her in early January and never heard anything back. I've interviewed at companies in person and over the phone for 12 years, and this was the first time ANY company ever failed to respond after the initial interview. I was really surprised at the level of disrespect shown by such a highly regarded company as Netflix.  Some advice for Netflix: 1. Offer candidates another chance for a first impression besides a five minute phone call with a 20-year old who has no work or life experience.  2. Practice professional courtesy by confirming with a candidate whether they are entitled to a second interview - after saying you would. Don't contact them out of the blue then completely blow them off.  3. Shred every copy of your work philosophy slideshow. It's one of the creepiest documents I've ever read and frankly I was much less interested in working at Netflix after reading it. It tries so hard to show how un-corporate the culture is that it ends up coming off completely conceited and self-aggrandizing - like something out of Egger's novel, The Circle.","Overall, the recruiter's questions were fairly innocuous."

756,2013-06-23,"A Director personally reached out to me via email in hopes to learn more about myself, my work and if I would be interested in migrating from my current company to theirs, and why.   It was Netflix, a house-hold name,  so naturally, I entertained the idea, sitting through the 1+ hours phone screenings with not only himself, but with another UX Manager.  After a vague, ambiguous job description of 'Lead Designer' was originally proposed to me, I still felt the need to at very least, explore their opportunity and see what could possibly come of the adventure. From there, it just went down hill.  After being sent through an e-mail funnel of 3+ recruiters and 2 managers (as if they couldn't figure out who's job was to do what), they invited me in for an 'all-day' interview from 10am - 5pm. I was then told I would receive a confirmation email with the details of the day/specs as soon as they had them. Transportation was also still up in the air, considering I had no real information to work with (as I live in SF, and they are located in Los Gatos).  Days went by, and the evening before the interview, a lengthy email filled with tables and over 8 different members I would be meeting with, was sent over to me. Not only was the title of the role quite different from the original conversation I already had ('Senior User Experience Designer'), but was followed by this statement:  ""*The interview is divided into two parts; based on the response from the Part 1 interviewers, you may or may not proceed with Part 2. Feedback will be given accordingly.""  Seriously? Quite the red flag right there. Who goes through the efforts to screen a candidate, seemingly review their work, and then ASK them to take time out of their existing schedule, just to still tell you that there is a very good chance you won't even get to round 2? I've actually had the pleasure of interviewing with Google, and even Adobe, and have never heard of such a tactic. I stressed my overall concerns to one of the recruiters, who then told another recruiter to follow up with me to tell me that the Director wanted to actually call and set my mind at ease.   After an hour or so of questionable excuses why I should still interview and/or not to take their emails verbatim, I reluctantly decided to give it my best shot. He even proceeded to tell me that candidates are only asked to leave due to very extreme circumstances. Regardless, after 6 hours of sitting in a confined room, talking to countless cold, un-interested managers, a terrible airplane styled lunch, a 45 min demo collab session, and a 30 min presentation to 4+ members, the lead Director still had the audacity to cut me off mid-sentence, to tell me this wasn't going to work, and that I wasn't 'collaborative' enough, when that's all I had strived for, for the last 3.5 hours -- was listen, speak and execute my thoughts vs/with theirs. They asked me to 'take charge', 'be a leader' etc and then turned around and demanded the opposite. Not only was I insulted at a very high level, but it was one of the most unprofessional, conflicting interview experiences of my life.   Even if I had been awarded the position, I would have declined due to the arrogance, misleading and poor excuse for culture and product process they represent.

784,2012-09-10,"I was not actively seeking a new job, but was contacted via LinkedIn by a persistent recruiter who asked me to reconsider the position when the discussion had grown cold after several weeks.  (Apparently they were having trouble filling the position).  I was pretty comprehensive job explaining my background/interests/skill set, had a phone screen with the recruiter, spoke with several people on their research team via Skype and telephone, and was invited to their campus for an interview.  I was curious to see how Netflix's approach to research had changed (if at all) in the year since the Qwickster debacle, and so figured I'd chat with them.  Had they figured out how to understand user needs and contexts?  Was there opportunity for a guy like me there?  Why not find out?  A schedule of interviews was provided, but it changed at the last minute.  Not a big deal, but it did raise a small red flag.  Bigger deal -- the position had been presented as a Director role, but had watered down to a Senior Manager role for the interview.  Had there been mutual interest after the on-site interview, I'd have brought this up ex post facto, but there wasn't.  The first person to interview me was a recruiting lead, who took some basic notes on my background.  I interviewed with two VPs.  One was aggressive and somewhat belittling.  The other was pleasant, but nonspecific about the role.  The overall onsite interview process was somewhat surreal for a tech company.  In fact, it felt more like an interview at a somewhat self-important Midwestern manufacturing company than a top Silicon Valley employer.    An excessive portion of the discussion focused around minutiae of my work history (like most qual professionals, I've had several stints of about 18 months to gain progressive experience and increase my compensation).  A somewhat arrogant (and completely false) subtext of ""you must not have worked out at those jobs"" was proffered, curious for a firm that claims to want ambitious people rather than tenured chair warmers.  While it was mildly insulting, it was also easily brushed aside.  Most surprising to me was the entirely conventional nature of their research operation, which likely explains why we mutually did not sense a good fit (and possibly why they seem to be having trouble hiring for the position).  Their operation appears to be an extremely basic (almost old fashioned) marketing research job, where ""qualitative research"" consists of focus groups and conventional in-lab work.  More advanced UCD practices seemed absent, and one of the interviewers actually seemed to get annoyed with me when I focused on a discussion of UCD as the center of high impact strategic qual.  That certainly contrasted markedly with the description of the position I'd received in previous phone/Skype discussions.  As part of this discussion, I was asked to describe ""my research process,"" and when I described individual bespoke initiatives, got interrupted a few times by a slightly annoyed interviewer.  I never got to fully explain an end-to-end project, which was a bit disappointing. (I'm not really a believer in one-size-fits all cookie-cutter processes.)  About ten minutes into the interview with the first VP, I'd pretty much decided I wasn't interested.  After the second VP interview, the recruiter came in and cut the process short (as is their standard) with a standard ""we're not interested in moving forward, we have no feedback"" line.  I breathed a sigh of relief -- I could have my afternoon back!  'm not sure that an ambitious and successful member of UPA, IXDA or QRCA would be especially excited by this opening.

786,2012-09-01,"After applying through the company's website using LinkedIn, I was contacted by a recruiter the very next day. She set up a phone interview for the following week. The conversation consisted of the standard, generic interview questions that many inexperienced recruiters ask. At the end of the interview she asked me to come in for a group interactive interview the following week.   Once there, I saw my recruiter, another recruiter, the operations manager, two HR managers (who only came to listen for a little bit), one CS supervisor, and five other applicants. Everyone was very friendly, yet it felt a little robotic and superficial. They informed us they were going to try a few new interview techniques after we sat through an informational powerpoint presentation. The powerpoint was basically verbatim off the company website. I felt like it was a waste of time... They gave us the opportunity to start a fake business and pick out our roles based on a list they provided. Then, we had to discuss why we chose those roles and why we would be a good fit for them, although I think we all were a little confused on what we were supposed to say... They said they were running out of time and had to skip the other exercises, so we moved on. Veritably, it felt a little pointless. We then toured the facility and broke up into groups of two. We got to meet with a CSR and listen in on calls while the team discussed our candidacy in private. The operations manager came out and asked individuals one-by-one to either come into his office, where he offered the interviewees a job, or walk them to the door, where he would tell them they ""would hear from the recruiter regarding next steps."" The annoying part was how long he made people wait, especially those he wasn't even considering.   Overall: I left with a good impression of the company. It appears they treat their employees well, but it's definitely limited in terms of growth. The recruiting staff is young and inexperienced; yes, it shows. The management wants to make you feel as though you're valued, whether that to be true or not is unknown.","There was no difficult questions, just a few pointless ones. "

789,2012-08-21,"I was approached by Netflix last year for a position in their API development team. This was part of their overall streaming initiative so I was quite interested in this post, as it was in line with my existing activities and future career goals. I did a phone interview with one of their directors and was eventually called in for an interview. The setup for the interview went fine, but the actual interview process was not very professionally handled. The first person who was interviewing me showed up late and did not even have a copy of my resume to reference. (Fortunately, I carry spares so I provided him with one) He basically just gave it a cursory look and then started into interview questions which actually were not at all related to the job itself. I am not certain if this person even knew what position I had applied for. He seemed generally disinterested in my answers and spent time on his laptop, paying little attention to my answers. Not really very professional. I was then interviewed by someone from HR. She was very young and quite arrogant to be honest, which was actually an issue in general with the individuals I interacted with. I then interviewed with a program manager who was the only decent individual in the crew, probably due to the fact that he was recent hire and likely not really absorbed into their borg culture over there. As I was ready to go onto my next interview, the hiring manager took me aside and said he was ending the interviews and that they were looking for someone more 'technical'. I am not sure how he came to the conclusion that I wasn't technical by their standards based on only getting feedback from one source (the first guy), so it kind of rubbed me the wrong way.

There was great synergy between my skill set, the position, Netflix's culture, the roadmap and many other aspects of the position. Within a couple days I was contacted by a recruiter who was very friendly and professional. We worked out a time for me to have a phone interview with the technical recruiter. The feedback I received was positive following this interview. Within a couple days the recruiter reached out again and we arranged a peer interview. When the peer interview was cut short, the peer agreed to continue our conversation on the weekend. Upon completing this interview, there was a long time period before I heard anything back. I later found out that this was due to the Netflix team having many meetings about my skill set and how they lined up with the role and what was needed beginning on day 1. I was not offered the positon. The hiring manager offered to keep me in mind if he became aware of any other openings that I would be a match for and offered to make any introductions he could.

She basically check listed my skills and gauged my interest in the position. The second interview (on phone) was with the Hiring Manager. The interviewer was very pleasant and was more interested in the way I solved and approached the various scenarios that he presented rather then the solutions themselves. The third & final interview (on site) ran for about four hours and consisted 1:1 interview sessions with the HR Director, who asked me about my salary expectations and the usual HR stuff, the QA Manager who was hiring and who had spoken to me earlier and Senior QA Engineers and QA Leads. The Manager and Engineers who interviewed me were pretty professional and represented different groups. The questioning, like the phone interview, focused on problem solving abilities and approach rather than the solution itself.

A manager of one of the device teams contacted me and completed the tech screen, which went well. He advised me at the end of the interview they would be sending a ""take home exercise"". The exercise arrived a few days later and I had the weekend to complete it. It consisted of mocking up a simple TV UI (keyboard controls) with some typical requirements and urging you to ""show off"" your abilities as far as making it abstract and extensible.   I completed the exercise and sent it back to them. A few days later I followed up with the recruiter, who said she heard positive feedback from the team, and arranged an in-person interview. I interviewed first with a HR person, and then had a technical interview with two engineers who asked me questions about my implementation, the conversation mostly about architecture and high level abstraction concepts, with some misc technical questions thrown in. After that, I had another technical interview with an additional two engineers. This interview was mostly whiteboard exercises. I did ok, arriving at a solution for all the questions with some coaching from the interviewers. I could tell they were looking for a specific implementation for some of the questions, so solving the problem wasn't enough. I wish I would have checked here first, because I was also asked the contains function and I got the sense they didn't like my recursive solution (which wasn't as efficient, but solved the problem and not bad for little whiteboarding exercise under pressure).  A few days later I followed up with the recruiter, who informed me I was not a ""perfect match"". Oh wells. I got the sense that they are truly looking for a perfect candidate - or rather someone who interviewed especially well that day and probably needed the entire team consensus before they would hire someone. They seemed to not be in ""hiring mode"" and could wait a long time, probably interviewing many candidates. The recruiter said she heard positive things, but wouldn't go into detail on areas of improvement.

Then, I had a 45-minute phone interview with an engineer who mostly talked about my resume and experiences without any technical questions.

During this time, lots of companies were doing interviews, even in-person interviews, but very few offers were being made.  Companies were in shopping mode, not hiring mode.  I looked on Glassdoor and was dismayed that this in-person interview was probably going to be a stressful waste of time.  But I reviewed the 100+ slides on the Netflix site about culture (which was interesting) and the slides on the Netflix business case.  I met with 2 engineers first for 45 minutes or so and we discussed my resume.  They showed me a screenshot and asked me to describe how I'd code it up and what issues to consider.  They asked my to code up a contains() function in JavaScript on the whiteboard which determines if one element contains another element.  Then, they left and another engineer interviewed me for 45 minutes.  He asked me to add the contains() function to all elements in the system (e.g. HTMLElement.prototype).  He also asked me to write the HTML and CSS for a layout with a header, a content pane, a navigation pane and a footer (memorize this solution! this question is asked at lots of companies).

The HR person also made a big fuss about how Netflix hires people who are an exact fit so they won't hire and you shouldn't accept unless everybody is 100% sure that the job was a perfect fit for you.

While it seems counter intuitive, you really should just ignore what company policy may be and make judgement calls. They'll teach you later what situations you can give out free goods, refunds, etc for.  During this role play they really want to see how you deal with difficult customer situations, and whether you can tell the difference between the customer doing something wrong (mailing in personal property) and the company did something wrong (sending out an unreadable disc).    After the role play the recruiter announced that she would walk us out individually for a little alone time.  She walked out half the people, and then told the rest of us that the previous statement was just a ploy to get rid of the people that didn't pass the group interview.

831,2011-11-27,"I applied online for a software engineering position at Netflix and received an invitation from a recruiter to interview for the position. After a brief phone screen, I was brought onsite to interview for about 4 hours with 5 people. These interviews were very technical and somewhat intense, but fair. They're very upfront about the high-performance culture and expectations at Netflix (see the deck on their website for more details), which I appreciated.   Following the first onsite interview, I was asked to come in again for another half day of interviews. These interviews were less technical and more about (1) the culture and organization of the work environment that I was coming from, and (2) whether or not I was a cultural fit for the company. I'd advise anyone who aspires to work at Netflix to think carefully about how you will answer these types of questions.   I'd thought that both days of onsite interviews went well, and so I was surprised a couple of days later to hear that they'd decided to pass on making me an offer.  I was disappointed, as I'd have liked to have worked there at the time. However, with everything that's happened with their handling of price increases and licensing issues over this past year, not getting the job turned out to be a blessing in disguise.   I did feel that the recruiting process was very fast-paced and organized, more so than some other companies with whom I'd interviewed.","Of everyone on your team at your current employer, who would you keep and who would you fire and why?"

She didn't make it clear that we were scheduling a phone interview until the end of the conversation. The next day at the appointed time, I received the call and the interview began. It was a little strange. It was as if she was just reading my resume from the bottom up and asked if I liked the job and why I left.

When I arrived, I was told that they only hired the first 50 people that arrived and I would not be given a job to work there.  I was employed at the time of interviewing with Netflix and since they offered me the job I quit the one I had.

She asked some of the basic questions: ""Why Netflix?"" seemed to be a big one. She also asked about any previous customer service or call center experience I had.   She then had me do a roleplay. She pretended to be a customer calling in about a disk that she had received that was not working, and she needed the movie right away. I played the part of the Customer Service Rep that she was calling.   After the successful phone interview, she set up a time on Friday for an in person group interview. I was told it would last 2 hours. She sent me an email with paperwork I needed to bring in as well as my resume.   I showed up early on Friday and there were already other candidates waiting. In all, 11 people were interviewed at the same time. They do this so they can see your personality with other people, whether you are outgoing or shy. Be interactive! Dont be afraid to talk to the other candidates, they could be your coworkers soon!   We then went on a mini tour of the place (which is really awesome!). We were put into a room where we each had a laptop. We had to take a couple of tests to see where we stand electronically. For one of them, we had to listen to actual call scenarios and pick apart what the customer really needed. For the other, we had to answer basic questions about modems, routers, mac vs pc, etc. For the last, we are given a Netflix login and asked questions about navigating the site. If you are done sooner than your other candidates, you are asked to meet in the lunch room, which is a great way to see some more of the building and even talk to current workers.   Once everyone is back, we return to the room and do some more roleplaying. The interviewer again pretends to be someone talking to you at your place of business and has some sort of complaint (it is not all Netflix, mine was about me owning a cable company). As long as you relate to the customer and show empathy, you should do just fine! She told us consistantly, help the customer as if you were their friend (great values for a company!!).   After that, some of the group was eliminated but in a polite way (she took the only gentleman to not pass and walked him outside). Then the rest of us were asked if we wanted to stay half an hour and shadow a current employee to see what it was like. We all agreed. We were all then each placed with a representative, and just listened in on calls for the next half hour (my guy really knew his stuff!).   Then we were all walked back to the main building that we first entered.

I did a lot of research on Glassdoor.com and spoke to several people about what Netflix's culture.  I was very concerned about it what I read and heard from the people I spoke with.  The accommodations that Netflix put me in was a very nice 4 star hotel, the Hotel Los Gatos is a place I would stay at again.

If you do not have what it takes you will not last very long at Netflix they make no bones about it.  Many questions focused on my experience with firing non-performers and how well I could recruit new talent.

The interesting thing was that the recruiter seemed to know a lot about the business and asked me some tough questions which made the process interesting.  I got a call back the same day and had another interviewed scheduled with the hiring manager for a few days later.  That interview was pretty simple with basic skills discussion and a brief overview of the job/company.  The hiring manager said immediately after the interview that I would be called in for an inperson interview.  I was scheduled for an all day interview for the next week.

She did not feel very happy with her position or the manager when I asked her a few questions about how she felt working there.  The third interview was a full hour of consulting style case study.

It was hard to carry a conversation on with her because she talked the entire time about how great Netflix is and how they only hire the best of the best. Overall, she was very respectful of what I had to say and then I was passed onto to the next hiring manager. The second hiring manager was one level above the first person I interviewed with. She was extremely rude and disrespectful from the very beginning. She told me that my handshake was weak and that my name was abnormal and difficult to pronounce. She also only asked me the same two questions as the first person. Every time she would go off topic, she would ask me to stick two the first initial questions she had presented me with. Whenever I would ask or say something, she would roll her eyes, pick at her extremely dirty nails, text message on her cell phone, or wave to her coworkers through the glass windows. She was beyond belief rude, condescending, and highly unprofessional. Not only did she disrespect me in terms of our conversation, but also bashed the fact that I had a Finance degree from a local state university.  She also continued to state that Netflix only picked the brightest and most experienced individuals and that they just didn't pick anyone off the street. She also asked if someone had contacted me from an application I submitted online or if I was referred. I told her that I was referred and she said that she was surprised anybody had called me in the first place  After 15 minutes of this horror, she finally decided that I was not the right candidate for the position and cut the last two interviews from the interviewing schedule. She did not walk me out, did not thank me for my time, and did not respond to any thank you emails that I sent to her.   From this interview, I am extremely disappointed in Netflix and their interviewing/hiring process. The interview was overall a waste of time; if I had known how condescending and impolite their employees are, I wouldn't have even bothered.   I'm disappointed that a company I follow is so poor at hiring, but ultimately I'm very happy that I did not get a job with Netflix.

880,2010-10-04,"The initial phone interview took about 30 minutes. The usual questions about your customer service experience, including a specific occasion in which you went above and beyond what was required of you to help a customer. Also some role playing, where the interviewer plays the role of a caller with a problem that you have to help her/him out with. At the end of the call, we set up a time for me to come in for a group interview.  The group interview was kind of ridiculous. You're going to hear a lot of bubbly talk about how great Netflix is, and how they do things different from their competitors, and blah, blah, blah. Just smile and let them keep talking. You will all be taken to a conference room and made to listen to a Power Point presentation, and then the main interviewer will call on people at random and ask about their impressions of the place and their experiences, if any, with Netflix in the past. Then you'll listen to some actual recorded customer service phone calls. At certain points, the interviewer will stop the tape and then pick a person at random to answer the caller's questions (in character as a CSR). You will get absolutely no feedback during this process, and if you try to bring a bit of levity to the situation the interviewer WILL NOT crack a smile. Just keep everything upbeat, force yourself to keep smiling, and avoid saying something like ""I'm sorry, but we can't really help you"" and you'll be OK. At the end of the interview, you'll be made to sit at a computer and, using a dummy Netflix login, answer a series of about 20 questions which you can look up the answers for on the site. It's timed, but you shouldn't have much difficulty getting to the end.  Overall, the group interview was an annoying slog to get through, but if you can fake enough enthusiasm, and have the basic conversational skills that most customer service jobs require, you'll do alright.",Describe an occasion in which you provided exceptional customer service in the past.

There wasn't actually a reason to be early, maybe they have a problem with people being late or something.  But, we (the group of us waiting to be interviewed) sat and chatted while we waited.

917,2009-12-04,"Phone interviews were a breeze. Easily made it through the SPSS test as well. However, they were looking for a very junior-level person who only implemented their orders. They didn't need a person who offers strategic thinking, and long-term benefits to the company - which is essentially what I was looking for in my new job. So it was a clear mismatch.  The Hiring Manager didn't seem to have any strategic thinking either - couldn't answer my questions in an intelligent manner either :) The online job description offered much more than what the position actually entailed. I got the same feedback from at least one other person who interviewed there for another marketing position as well.  Employees, in general, seemed to have a very snobbish attitude.","Hiring Managers' questions were too simplistic, mostly about survey implementation - a clear indication that the position was not going to be challenging enough.

918,2009-11-26,"I was up for a operations supervisor job at Netflix's facility in Northboro, Ma. I went through all the interviews ranging from the operations manager, HR, and finally with the regional manager. They seemed to like me, the interviews went well until I asked a question to all of them. I told them the that the CEO of Netflix Reed Hastings made a comment in the Wall Street Journal in July addressing their shareholders, that Netflix plans to be 100 percent operation in 5-7 years with online streaming and will be getting out of DVD copies all together. So I asked all the interviewers if this is true what will become of operations personnel in that time frame. Well, they all became very defensive stutttering that there will always be a need for DVD copies blah blah blah. They all became very irate with the question. I was very surprised since I was asking a question based on a factual statement by the owner of the company. They ended up not offering me the job and when I asked the recruiter why he said that they all felt I would not be a team player. He stated the regional manager felt that my devotion to the corporate mission would be in question. Huh? All I asked was what they thought of the CEO's comment and how it would impact operations personnel in 5-7 years. Of course this implies that there might be a 70 percent reduction in their workforce if they go to online straming forcing most of their operations hubs to shutdown. What a joke! I'm glad I dodged that bullet.

925,2009-10-15,"First spoke to a recruitment consultant (internal agent) for 30 minutes, then had a 40 minute interview with the hiring manager. The recruitment consultant was very thorough and seemed to know her roles very well. I felt she was able to make a good assessment of people she screened. The interview with the hiring manager was a positive experience. I felt I was interviewing him, more than him interviewing me (a good thing, perhaps!). I got the impression that the open job spec was a ""placeholder"" to enable the team to ""fish"" for the right candidate for the team as a whole. This made it difficult to home in on the specific points i needed to hit.
